<p>Her most recent piece of feedback was</p>
  <blockquote>
    What strikes me about your code right now is that it&#39;s not very composable
  </blockquote>

<p>Well I have to admit I had no idea what she meant by this, although it was in reference to a problem I was highlighting myself of <em>I&#39;m passing too much data around</em></p>
<p>It turns out that this is pretty much what the FP guys mean when they say that code isn&#39;t composable.</p>
<p>Obeerne of the beautiful things about the way languages like Clojure make you build up code, is that the functions you write are supposed to be re-usable across very basic and well-known data structures.</p>
<h3>Composability and Types</h3>
<p><a href="http://clojure.org/sequences">Sequences</a> are probably the best structures to be operating on top of, maybe with some primitives as directives of how to operate on them. </p>
<p>User defined structures such as a &quot;vector&quot; probably come in next and then my big chunk of state as a hash... well that&#39;s the worst - especially if I&#39;m passing it around as one big thing all the time.</p>
<p>With that in mind, suddenly we have a use for defined data structures like records (something I have been putting off for a while), and perhaps I can begin to solve my awkward relationship with that big ball of state. Something I have been muttering about for the past few blog entries.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;ve read the <a href="http://clojure.org/datatypes">page on types</a> in Clojure and from what I understand it seems that deftype is for structures with no behaviour, and defrecord is for more OOP scenarios but there is also <a href="http://clojure.org/protocols">defprotocol</a> which is somehow related to both and will probably help me with my current data-ball-of-mud problem.</p>
<p>To further confound me, the docs have snippets like this in them</p>
  <blockquote>
  Protocols are fully reified
  </blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll need a dictionary and a copy of SICP to understand this and my brain is melting a bit so I go to find wine. Nice cool wine on a terrace overlooking St Pauls Cathedral and try to make sense of these docs a bit more.</p>
<h3>Composability and Space Invaders</h3>
<p>Starting at the other end of the problem - away from wordy confusion, it&#39;s very easy to see that there are some basic data types in my Space Invaders game and I have some basic operations over the top of them.</p>
<p>First up, I&#39;m passing &#39;rects&#39; all over the place, and a rect is defined as </p>
<pre><code><span class="title">x</span> : <span class="type">LHS</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> the rect
<span class="title">y</span> : <span class="type">TOP</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> the rect
<span class="title">w</span> : <span class="type">Width</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> the rect
<span class="title">h</span> : <span class="type">Height</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> the rect</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s the state, and there are some basic operations over the top of this - some which involve mutation and some which do not</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw it (no mutation of internal state) </li>
<li>bottom of the rect (no mutation)</li>
<li>RHS of the rect (no mutation)</li>
<li>move left/right/up/down (mutation - perhaps just &#39;move&#39;)</li>
</ul>
<p>From what I understand of the docs, I could probably get a lot done by defining a rect as a record, and exposing these as methods on that record, this might make some of the code easier to follow.</p>
<p>I could also use a protocol to describe two things as being &#39;collideable&#39; (a suggestion from my tutor), which is the Clojure equivalent to an interface if I understand correctly.</p>
<h3>No code here</h3>
<p>I&#39;ll leave the implementation of this to the next post, as this is quite a lot of data to digest and I highly recommend reading the above docs if you&#39;re following along with my learning.</p>

<p><strong>I did a tidy up</strong></p>
<p>I got rid of my stupid nested structures, and put the data for bullets into the top-level map, instead of</p>
<pre><code>[<span class="symbol">:bullets</span> <span class="symbol">:active</span>]
[<span class="symbol">:bullets</span> <span class="symbol">:lastFiringTicks</span>]</code></pre>
<p>I now have</p>
<pre><code>[<span class="symbol">:bullets</span>]
[<span class="symbol">:last-firing-ticks</span>]</code></pre>
<p>It makes things much simpler, the code at the start of this entry can be found <a href="https://github.com/robashton/clojure-spaceinvaders/blob/085c0249e54c19d189dfba6e006205c90914fc56/game.cljs">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The space invaders need to invade some space</strong></p>
<p>When the invaders reach the end of the row, their direction changes - they also need to drop down by a certain amount of space and thus attack the earth.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;ll do here is break this up a bit (which I&#39;m okay with anyway because the above is quite hard to read)</p>

    <span class="list">(<span class="title">invert-enemies-direction</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span> state)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now I&#39;ve done this, it should be fairly easy to update their y positions as part of that invert direction call.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> invert-enemies-direction [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> state 
         <span class="keyword">:direction</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:direction</span> state)</span></span> <span class="number">-1</span>)</span></span>
         <span class="keyword">:enemies</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">map</span><span class="body">

                      <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:enemies</span> state)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Fairly sure there are some tricks I&#39;m missing here for making that sort of thing prettier, but it does the job pretty well and my invaders come to say hello. </p>
<ul>
<li>Associate this expression with the enemies field in the map</li>
<li>The expression is a map of the current enemies field</li>
<li>The map associates a modified &#39;y&#39; with each enemy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ending conditions</strong></p>
<p>Two basic conditions now present themselves for victory or defeat</p>
<ul>
<li>Enemies reach the bottom of the screen</li>
<li>Enemies are all destroyed</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking the easiest approach here, I&#39;ll just perform a page re-direct on failure, and start the next level on success.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> update-state [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">validate-end-conditions</span><span class="body">
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-bullets</span><span class="body">
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-player</span><span class="body">
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-enemies</span><span class="body">
          <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-direction</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> validate-end-conditions [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">cond</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">enemies-are-all-dead</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:enemies</span> state)</span></span>)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">start-next-level</span><span class="body">)</span></span>
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">enemies-are-at-the-gate</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:enemies</span> state)</span></span>)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">show-game-over</span><span class="body">)</span></span>
        <span class="keyword">:else</span> state)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now obviously <em>show-game-over</em> isn&#39;t going to actually return any state, but we&#39;ll be on a different page then so that&#39;s no big deal. <em>start-next-level</em> will have an opportunity to create completely new state for our next level so that works out nicely too.</p>
<p><strong>Game over dude</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> enemies-are-at-the-gate [enemies]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">&gt;</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">apply</span><span class="body"> max <span class="list">(<span class="title">map</span><span class="body"> <span class="keyword">:y</span> enemies)</span></span>)</span></span> <span class="number">400</span>)</span></span>)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> show-game-over []
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">set</span><span class="body">! <span class="list">(<span class="body">. js/document -location)</span></span> <span class="string">"gameover.html"</span>)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is another example of how delightfully terse Clojure can be at times :)</p>
<p><strong>The enemies are dead, long live the enemies</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> enemies-are-all-dead [enemies]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">not</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">first</span><span class="body"> enemies)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Apparently nil and false in Clojure are our only falsy values, so the above will work (first returns nil if the sequence is empty).</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> start-next-level []
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">create-state</span><span class="body">)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>For now, let&#39;s just go with a re-start of the whole thing when we&#39;ve killed all the enemies so everything starts from the beginning once more.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty levels</strong></p>
<p>Now we have game over and next level, let&#39;s look at next level and what it means.</p>
<p>Currently I have a few hard-coded values lying around</p>
<ul>
<li>How far do enemies drop down each pass</li>
<li>How fast do enemies move from left to right?</li>
<li>How frequently do our bullets fire?</li>
<li>How fast are our bullets?</li>
<li>How fast does our defender move?</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of the time in my JS games, this is all modelled as state local to my entities and this is quite awkward. I can probably do better here.</p>
<p>The only piece of state I need for any of this is &quot;current level&quot;, so I&#39;mma go ahead and stick that around</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> create-state [level]

          <span class="keyword">:else</span> state)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And the implementation (for now) </p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> firing-rate [state] <span class="list">(<span class="title">min</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">15</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">-</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">30</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">2</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:level</span> state)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> enemy-descent-speed [state] <span class="number">25</span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is quite tidy and gives me the ability to adjust these values easily when experimenting with the game. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not so happy with passing the complete &#39;state&#39; into each of these methods, but pulling out the level at the point of invocation seems a greater evil in this case.</p>
<p>Next up, I&#39;ll look at scoring as a side effect of enemy destruction, and re-visit how I manage the logic and state around that.</p>

<p>  <img src="/img/israel.jpg" width="300px" class="inline-right"></p>
<p>Because I was so fed up, I decided I wanted to do something a bit different and because I like to meet new people and see new things, <a href="/entries/why-work-for-free.html">I offered up my time for free</a> providing my expenses were covered and I could therefore stretch a bit further.</p>
<p>In that time I worked for a number of companies across the globe, heading as far east as Israel and heading as far west as Hawaii (primarily for the surfing), and had my plans not been altered by <a href="/entries/im-leaving-.net.html">finding a start-up I believe in</a> I would have probably ended up doing some work in Hong Kong and Australia too.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all very well and good, but what did I learn (or get reminded of)? Hippy stuff coming up.</p>
<h1>Experience in Tool/Language X is a stupid thing to ask for</h1>
<p>  <img src="/img/eurovision.jpg" width="300px" class="inline-left"></p>
<p>In all but one of my little engagements, I was handed some work to do where I&#39;d had pretty much zero engagement with the technology involved. The hardest of these was probably <a href="/entries/ometa-odata-odear---polishing-it-off.html">OMeta</a> which I blogged about - I had less than two weeks on site and I was asked to write a new feature for a product in it.  No problem - hands up &quot;I&#39;m feeling stupid, please help me with this&quot; - two days later I was flying thanks to the help of my colleagues.</p>
<p>I feel pretty confident in saying that if you give any motivated/experienced software developer a challenge in something they have never used before, then they&#39;ll get on that stuff and make it happen providing they have some similar experience and you have an in-house knowledge pool for them to draw on.</p>
<h1>Take the bullshit away and let me get on with the job</h1>
<p>  <img src="/img/bridge.jpg" width="300px" class="inline-right"></p>
<p>Turning up to help @ayende do RavenDB was brilliant, <em>here is  the list of crap, have fun</em>. I set about that list like a maniac and got crap done fast. How? No meetings, no politics, no pressure. Even outside of work, Ayende had provided me with a car, apartment, GPS, fuel card etc so I didn&#39;t have to think about anything else other than what I needed/wanted to do. This was done on the basis that if I wasn&#39;t sure how to do a task I&#39;d stick my hand up and go &quot;Ahaahahaa&quot; (which happened more than once). </p>
<p>The enterprise world is so screwed in that regard, those weeks which were pretty much just 40 hour long meetings were 40 hours of wasted time.</p>
<h1>Failure setting us back? No - just keep rolling forward!</h1>
<p>I managed to roll a car over while I was in the Outer Hebrides, it was one of those &quot;everything happened at the same time to make this accident happen&quot; occurences, and it looked something like this!</p>
<p>  <img src="/img/car.jpg" width="300px" class="inline-left"></p>
<p>Whoops! Beyond the initial flailing around and shock, once I&#39;d gotten a lift back to civilisation with a passerby, I hung out with a cup of coffee and called the car hire company with the news that I&#39;d completely destroyed their vehicle.</p>
<p>Two hours later we&#39;d got it dragged up the hill, made sure no sheep were going to escape and I was back in Stornoway asking the immortal question:</p>
<p>  <div style="float: none; clear: both;"></div>
  <blockquote>Can I have a another car please?</blockquote></p>
<p>This I received, and I got on with my holiday. Because I was wearing my seatbelt, because I&#39;d paid for the extra insurance, because I was going slowly due to the adverse conditions the important stuff had been taken care of, the damage was limited and rather than stress over something I couldn&#39;t change I just <em>moved on</em>.</p>
<p>The same happened in Israel when I broke the car that Oren let me use, &quot;no problem, we can solve this problem by lending you my own one&quot;, let&#39;s not let things get in the way of having a good time folks. This attitude is what makes people like that able to get on and and <em>do</em>, because there is no fear of failure - just a focus on what to do next.</p>
<h1>Be one with the framework/team/system</h1>
<p>  <img src="/img/building.jpg"  width="300px" class="inline-right"></p>
<p>I&#39;m not the biggest fan of ASP.NET MVC, I&#39;m not the biggest fan of Rails (as you can see on Twitter no doubt!), I don&#39;t really like Backbone or Angular or any JS frameworks for that matter, I prefer to do my development vanilla for a plethora of good reasons.</p>
<p>A lot of teams don&#39;t feel that way, and as an external body I don&#39;t have a say in this matter, <em>&quot;Oh you&#39;re using RequireJS? <a href="/entries/why-i-stopped-using-amd.html">BULLSHEEEEEEEEEEIT</a>&quot;</em>. It turns out if you leave your opinions at the door and just get on with crap, do things in a way that&#39;s idiomatic for that environment and keep asking &quot;What&#39;s the best way to do this&quot;, then you can get stuff done quick.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll still run into those edge cases that you get with frameworks (If you go vanilla, you don&#39;t have edge cases, you just have features), but these can be glossed over if you have control over the feature-set and then you will deliver. <a href="/entries/this-week,-lets-create-a-start-up---day-5.html">Start-up in a week</a>? NO PROBLEM SIR.</p>
<p>As a bonus, bitching about all the crazy decisions made in that framework is fun on Twitter so it&#39;s nice to get the opportunity to do so...</p>
<h1>I don&#39;t need any of that crap</h1>
<p>I lived out of a suitcase for this time and had to ruthlessly discard things that took up needless space. I had a trial run for the first few weeks where I tried to lug my Moka pot and coffee grinder around with me but sadly had to replace that with the spare laptop for doing .NET work.</p>
<p>What did I end up with after a few iterations of discard and re-pack?</p>
<ul>
<li>A week&#39;s worth of clothing</li>
<li>A MBA running Debian for doing most things</li>
<li>A heavy duty windows laptop for running Visual Studio</li>
<li>An iPad for reading on/watching porn</li>
<li>Toothbrush/paste, shampoo, conditioner and product (I have long hair!)</li>
<li>iPhone + Headphones for communication and music</li>
</ul>
<p>So successful has this activity been, that even though I&#39;ve now been in my new job in London for two months and I&#39;m still living out of this suitcase in managed apartments, hostels and friends&#39; sofas not worrying about it too much. The important thing is to find a launderette that&#39;ll do all your clothes for a modest fee!</p>
<p>Okay, it&#39;s hardly a complete stripping down of &quot;material goods&quot;, and I&#39;m still lugging around several thousand pounds worth of Apple gear, but it&#39;s nice to know that I can pack up and quit what I&#39;m doing anytime I like and just skip country <em>like that</em>, with no baggage (literally).</p>
<h1>Money isn&#39;t important</h1>
<p>I was offered pay for a number of roles while I was doing this, and turned it all down because I felt it would sully what I was trying to do. Also - I felt it would muck up the balance where the people I was working for <em>really</em> wanted me to be happy because it was all they were giving me. </p>
<p>Money to employers is an easy way to motivate employees and has been proven not to work, take it out of the equation and they have to work a lot harder - worth thinking about.</p>
<h1>Happiness is so freakin&#39; important</h1>
<p>So I&#39;ve said in this <a href="http://tekpub.com/products/change-it-up">Tekpub video that I helped make</a>, I didn&#39;t realise how miserable I was until I went and did this. Spending half a year in a state of bliss would be hard to describe to the person that was slaving away in the enterprise a year ago.</p>
<p>  <img src="/img/waves.jpg" width="300px" class="inline-right"></p>
<p>Seriously though, the enterprise world was killing me, and for what? Filling my bank account with money that I didn&#39;t need (I don&#39;t have any dependents). It didn&#39;t feel like that at the time of course but I&#39;m so much happier with less because I&#39;m <em>doing more with it</em></p>
<p>If your job isn&#39;t something you look forward to each day, OMG CHANGE IT and don&#39;t mope about how you can&#39;t change it because OMG YOU CAN. (Footnote: It&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll be able to change the culture of a company that&#39;s gone bad if you can&#39;t simply fire all the dead weight, and you&#39;ll just get frustrated trying so don&#39;t bother).</p>
<h1>I&#39;m responsible for my own happiness</h1>
<p>I know what I want now, and I know when I know what I want and I&#39;m not afraid to say it. In a way, I&#39;m now a dangerous person to hire because unless your environment is one I enjoy I&#39;m not going to stick around for longer than a few months, no matter what the reward is. The same goes for my personal relationships with other people and personal life in general, being happy is too important to compromise for other things and I&#39;m responsible for making that happen.</p>
<p>Quitting and doing this has showed me that there are people out there that <em>are</em> happy, and has given me the motivation to find out how I can do that and make a living at the same time.</p>
<h1>People are generally okay</h1>
<p>  <img src="/img/rainbow.jpg" width="300px" class="inline-left"></p>
<p>To all the people who stopped their car to see if I was okay when I&#39;d crashed mine, to the lady who gave me a lift to the nearest town and gave me money for a bacon sandwich, to the multitude of people who offered me lifts when I was walking around in Hawaii or got me home from the bar, to everybody who gave me directions when they saw me ambling through the greek countryside, to the Israeli security who called her colleagues over to have a good laugh after asking why I had the Azerbaijan visa stamp in my passport, to the parents of the boss I&#39;d never met who let a stranger stay at their house for 2 weeks, to everybody who has offered me money to do interesting things, to the people that I let down but didn&#39;t moan about it and to all those people that I&#39;ve been drinking with over the past year - it has been a laugh and nobody has tried to do me over. You&#39;re all okay.</p>

<p><strong>The collision detection itself</strong></p>
<p>Well, collision is a nice easy pure function to write and because I have my rect primitive I can pretty use these.</p>
<p>My first stab looks like this</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> collides-with [one two]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [one-left <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> one)</span></span>
        one-right <span class="list">(<span class="title">+</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> one)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:w</span> one)</span></span>)</span></span>
        one-top <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> one)</span></span>
        one-bottom <span class="list">(<span class="title">+</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> one)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:h</span> one)</span></span>)</span></span>
        two-left <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> two)</span></span>
        two-right <span class="list">(<span class="title">+</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> two)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:w</span> two)</span></span>)</span></span>
        two-top <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> two)</span></span>
        two-bottom <span class="list">(<span class="title">+</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> two)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:h</span> two)</span></span>)</span></span>]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">cond</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">&lt;</span><span class="body"> one-right two-left)</span></span> false
          <span class="list">(<span class="title">&gt;</span><span class="body"> one-left two-right)</span></span> false
          <span class="list">(<span class="title">&lt;</span><span class="body"> one-bottom two-top)</span></span> false
          <span class="list">(<span class="title">&gt;</span><span class="body"> one-top two-bottom)</span></span> false
          <span class="keyword">:else</span> true)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I kinda feel as if this is over-doing the point a little though, and those extra variables I&#39;ve gone and made could probably just be represented by functions.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> rect-right [rect] <span class="list">(<span class="title">+</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> rect)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:w</span> rect)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>
<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> rect-bottom [rect] <span class="list">(<span class="title">+</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> rect)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:h</span> rect)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> collides-with [one two]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">cond</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">&lt;</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">rect-right</span><span class="body"> one)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> two)</span></span>)</span></span> false
          <span class="list">(<span class="title">&gt;</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> one)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">rect-right</span><span class="body"> two)</span></span>)</span></span> false
          <span class="list">(<span class="title">&lt;</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">rect-bottom</span><span class="body"> one)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> two)</span></span>)</span></span> false
          <span class="list">(<span class="title">&gt;</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> one)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">rect-bottom</span><span class="body"> two)</span></span>)</span></span> false
          <span class="keyword">:else</span> true)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s a small change, but if I want to use these concepts elsewhere then I&#39;ll be able to far easier and this is far easier on the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Using the collision detection</strong></p>
<p>Okay so I&#39;m being quite lazy here, the efficient way to do collision detection across a scene is to use a linear hashmap and only test rects in adjacent cells. I only have a few space invaders though so I&#39;ll take the hit of a more brute force solution (although I think this would be quite fun to implement in a functional manner so I&#39;ll come back to it)</p>
<p>So, obviously I need to adjust my sequences based on whether bullets are intersecting with aliens.</p>
<p>This is probably the complicated bit, and I&#39;ll start off being really lazy about how I evaluate this.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to remove bullets from the collection if they&#39;re intersecting</li>
<li>We need to remove aliens from the collection if they&#39;re intersecting</li>
<li><em>in the future we&#39;d need to increase points</em></li>
<li><em>in the future we&#39;d need to show some animation</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m getting the feeling that doing all of this with my ball of state is going to get un-wieldy and I might want to look into something more functional <a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/23.html">like in this series</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#39;ll press forwards with my current solution because I want something that works.</p>
<p><strong>My first attempt</strong></p>
<p>My first attempt was a failure, I thought it&#39;d be simple to just loop through several times and do something like</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> bullet-collides-with-enemy [bullet state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">not</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">not-any</span><span class="body">? 
     <span class="list">(<span class="title">fn</span><span class="body"> [enemy] <span class="list">(<span class="title">collides-with</span><span class="body"> enemy bullet)</span></span>)</span></span> 
     <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:enemies</span> state)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> enemy-collides-with-bullet [enemy state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">not</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">not-any</span><span class="body">? 
     <span class="list">(<span class="title">fn</span><span class="body"> [bullet] <span class="list">(<span class="title">collides-with</span><span class="body"> bullet enemy)</span></span>)</span></span> 
     <span class="list">(<span class="title">get-in</span><span class="body"> [<span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="keyword">:active</span>] state)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And filter out enemies/bullets in the seq for these things, this is an awful idea because of multiple iterations it&#39;s also an awful idea because written in this way it&#39;s hard to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Second attempt</strong></p>
<p>A better idea would be to iterate once, ask for all the colliisons that have taken place and then use this information to create a new version of the state without the affected enemies/bullets in it.</p>
<p>This moves me closer in the direction described by the article I linked above so I&#39;ll give it a go.</p>
<p>I can write a function that does this and returns a list of the collisions.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> get-bullet-enemy-collisions [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [bullet <span class="list">(<span class="title">active-bullets</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>]
    { <span class="keyword">:bullet</span> bullet
      <span class="keyword">:alien</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">first</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">enemies-colliding-with-bullet</span><span class="body"> bullet state)</span></span>)</span></span>})</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>But this won&#39;t actually be effective I don&#39;t think, because I&#39;m returning a map of maps which would need comparing against the other maps in order to remove them from the collection they&#39;re in.</p>
<p>By-reference comparison won&#39;t work, maps are (as I understand it) compared by value - and while this would work it&#39;s not &quot;correct&quot;. Identity is what we want to compare against here and our bullets and aliens don&#39;t have identies.</p>
<p><strong>Third attempt</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve found <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/map-indexed">map-indexed</a> and <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/keep-indexed">keep-indexed</a>, which will allow me to do pretty much the same as above but return a list of indexes into the collections which represent collisions.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> get-bullet-enemy-collisions [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">keep-indexed</span><span class="body"> #<span class="list">(<span class="body">{ <span class="keyword">:bullet</span> %<span class="number">1</span>
                    <span class="keyword">:alien</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">first</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">enemies-colliding-with-bullet</span><span class="body"> bullet state)</span></span>)</span></span>})</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> enemies-colliding-with-bullet [bullet state]

<p>I&#39;ve also discovered that little # symbol, which appears to be shorthand for an anonymous function with a 1-indexed list of arguments.</p>
<p>Anyway, now I have a list of collisions that have taken place in my game world, I can filter out the items I don&#39;t want any more.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t figure out an easy way of using this data though, so back to</p>
<p><strong>Option one again</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> collide-bullets [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> 
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc-in</span><span class="body"> state [<span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="keyword">:active</span>]
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">remove</span><span class="body"> #<span class="list">(<span class="title">collides-with-any</span><span class="body"> % <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:enemies</span> state)</span></span>)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">active-bullets</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>
    <span class="keyword">:enemies</span>
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">remove</span><span class="body"> #<span class="list">(<span class="title">collides-with-any</span><span class="body"> % <span class="list">(<span class="title">active-bullets</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:enemies</span> state)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> collides-with-any [one, others]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">some</span><span class="body"> #<span class="list">(<span class="title">collides-with</span><span class="body"> % one)</span></span> others)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Iterate through the list twice and just remove any affected entities.</p>
<p>Note I can use the old verson of the state when doing my <em>collides-with-any</em> calls, and stick the results into multiple calls on top of the new state. This is much easier to understand than my first attempt however so at least doesn&#39;t have the pitfall of being completely opaque.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still really not liking this solution as it involves multiple iterations of the two collections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare each bullet against all the enemies</li>
<li>Compare each enemy against all the bullets</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ll come back to this no doubt when it comes to adding scoring, explosions and sound, because I&#39;m going to need to execute a lot more logic based on these collisions.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to press on and add some more gameplay though, as once I have an end-to-end game I&#39;ll hopefully have gained more understanding and be able to reason about all of this better.</p>

<p><strong>assoc-in vs update-in</strong></p>
<p>Here is some code I wrote</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> enemiesLogic [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [direction <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:direction</span> state)</span></span>
        enemies <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:enemies</span> state)</span></span>
        func <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"><span class="list">(<span class="title">=</span><span class="body"> direction <span class="number">1</span>)</span></span> inc dec)</span></span>
       ]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> state <span class="keyword">:enemies</span>
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [enemy enemies]
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> enemy <span class="keyword">:x</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">func</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> enemy)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>
      )</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>What I&#39;m essentially doing is </p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a function to apply based on the direction</li>
<li>Creating a new enemies collection where that function has been applied to each enemy</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, why bother with this? We can do</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> enemiesLogic [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [direction <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:direction</span> state)</span></span>
        enemies <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:enemies</span> state)</span></span>
        func <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"><span class="list">(<span class="title">=</span><span class="body"> direction <span class="number">1</span>)</span></span> inc dec)</span></span>
       ]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> state <span class="keyword">:enemies</span>
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [enemy enemies]
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-in</span><span class="body"> enemy [<span class="keyword">:x</span>] func)</span></span>
      )</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>update-in takes in a func to enact on the value, rather than the new value and saves us precious reading time. Thinking about it, we can actually save some effort here too.</p>
<p>This makes a big difference in cases where I&#39;ve been lazy and done this</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> bullet <span class="keyword">:y</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">dec</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> bullet)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Looks better like</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">update-in</span><span class="body"> bullet [<span class="keyword">:y</span>] dec)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Passing around functions seems pretty functional.</p>
<p><strong>State doesn&#39;t define an object</strong></p>
<p>Why do I have this?</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initEnemy [x y w h]
 {
  <span class="keyword">:x</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> x <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span>
  <span class="keyword">:y</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> y <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span>
  <span class="keyword">:w</span> w
  <span class="keyword">:h</span> h
 }
)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initPlayer [x y w h]
 {
  <span class="keyword">:x</span> x
  <span class="keyword">:y</span> y
  <span class="keyword">:w</span> w
  <span class="keyword">:h</span> h
 }
)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initBullet [x y w h]
 {
  <span class="keyword">:x</span> x
  <span class="keyword">:y</span> y
  <span class="keyword">:w</span> w
  <span class="keyword">:h</span> h
 }
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Seems to me that everything in my game is a rect, and what changes between these everything is the behaviour that is performed over that state.</p>
<p>So, death to these things and in with</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title"><span class="built_in">defn</span></span> initRect <span class="collection">[x y w h]</span>
 <span class="collection">{
  <span class="attribute">:x</span> x
  <span class="attribute">:y</span> y
  <span class="attribute">:w</span> w
  <span class="attribute">:h</span> h
 }</span>
)</span></code></pre>
<p>Actually, I&#39;m pulling this structure apart in a number of places, such as my drawing functions</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [{<span class="keyword">:keys</span> [x y w h]} bullet]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">drawSquare</span><span class="body"> ctx x y w h <span class="string">"#000"</span>)</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>A solution to this would be to make drawSquare take in this map and de-construct it there. I&#39;ve established that this is a primitive I want in my application and I&#39;ll use it as such.</p>
<p>I could further solidify this by turning it into a Record but I&#39;m not yet feeling any pain from not having it as one so I won&#39;t bother..</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> drawSquare [[ctx width height] rect c]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">set</span><span class="body">! <span class="list">(<span class="body">. ctx -fillStyle)</span></span> c)</span></span>
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [{<span class="keyword">:keys</span> [x y w h]} rect]
    <span class="list">(<span class="body">.fillRect ctx x y w h)</span></span> 
  )</span></span>
)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> enemiesRender [ctx state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [enemies <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:enemies</span> state)</span></span>]

  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In other thoughts, these functions are all the same apart from the colour of the rect, it seems a bit daft to me, how about</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> renderRects [ctx rects colour]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">doseq</span><span class="body"> [rect rects] 
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">drawSquare</span><span class="body"> ctx enemy colour)</span></span>
  )</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> enemiesRender [ctx state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">renderRects</span><span class="body"> ctx <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:enemies</span> state)</span></span> <span class="string">"#FF0"</span>)</span></span>

  <span class="list">(<span class="title">drawSquare</span><span class="body"> ctx <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:player</span> state)</span></span> <span class="string">"#F00"</span>)</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Keeping the number of data structures to a minimum and re-using tiny little functions seems to be a thing in these parts.</p>
<p><strong>Naming clojure constructs</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been a naughy boy and stuck to my JavaScript ways of doing things with the camelCase all up in the show.</p>
<p>Turns out that Clojure fiends prefer hyphenation-on-their-names and I can kinda get behind that.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll also take the opportunity to formally start using &#39;rect&#39; everywhere instead a combination of  &#39;square&#39; and &#39;rect&#39; etc, and do a general tidy up of names.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll not show them all, but in essence </p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> bulletsRender [ctx state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">renderRects</span><span class="body"> ctx <span class="list">(<span class="title">get-in</span><span class="body"> state [<span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="keyword">:active</span>])</span></span> <span class="string">"#000"</span>)</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Will become</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> render-bullets [ctx state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">render-rects</span><span class="body"> ctx <span class="list">(<span class="title">get-in</span><span class="body"> state [<span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="keyword">:active</span>])</span></span> <span class="string">"#000"</span>)</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And so on (so don&#39;t get confused in latter entries where the names of things have changed!)</p>
<p>The only downside to this arrangement is ctrl-p is now broken in vim for method names, this is a chance for the Emacs people to point and laugh at me.</p>
<p><strong>Parenthesis white space</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m getting little value from new-lining my parentheses.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> update-state [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-bullets</span><span class="body">
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-player</span><span class="body">
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-enemies</span><span class="body">
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-direction</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
      )</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>When re-factoring or moving code around, I&#39;m using the vim shortcuts </p>
<ul>
<li>vi(</li>
<li>va(</li>
<li>ci(</li>
<li>ca(</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on, and actually it would be easier if I could just use left and right to move to the brace I want to grab the contents of.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m going to sort that out too and go with</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> update-state [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-bullets</span><span class="body">
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-player</span><span class="body">

        <span class="list">(<span class="title">update-direction</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Gasp. Radical. This will reduce my vertical space usage and allow me to see more context on my screen (I&#39;m a k+r person in C#/JS etc so I&#39;m totally up in this way of doing things)</p>

<p>Then George Lucas announced he was going to make NEW STAR WARS, and everybody got excited - including people who hadn&#39;t really been <em>that</em> into it to begin with. We traipsed down to the cinema in droves to find out that in place of the epic star wars action we expected, we got Jar Jar Binks.</p>
<p><em>That&#39;s how I feel now</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been on that .NET platform thing for a while now, although I&#39;ve been writing JS for a long time and my heart has never really left the world of C and C++ I can definitely be considered as one of those people who cast an eye on the promised land of Ruby on Rails acknowledging that it was apparently very good but things were fine without it thankyou very much.</p>
<p>Only now I&#39;m doing Ruby on Rails, and I&#39;ve missed the first few iterations and the software I&#39;ve found myself using is the programming equivalant of Jar Jar sodding binks.</p>
<p><em>TLDR</em></p>
<p>This was going to be a rant, but I got distracted by building stuff and never finished the entry. Oh well - I kinda like it like this.</p>

<p>So how have we managed to get this far without any full-time staff of our own?</p>
<h3>Enter Featurist</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.featurist.co.uk/">Featurist</a> are a band of contractors/consultants/hit-team/merry-men who join companies as a team and build software. Right now they&#39;ve been building stuff with us whilst working on other more enterprisy .NET contracts.</p>
<p>Normally at companies who consider themselves &quot;.NET shops&quot;, you&#39;ll get one or two really good people and then a big pile of others who slow the whole thing down whether it be intentional or through general incompetence. Now I&#39;m sat in a room of half a dozen of these folks and it&#39;s completely bizarre to find yourself saying &quot;I believe in this one thing&quot;, and having a whole team of people presenting rational and thought out cases for and against your view point.</p>
<p>Now, at this start-up we&#39;re pretty much slinging Ruby all over the show (And boy am I hating on the Ruby the past couple of weeks), and I&#39;m finding myself needing these guys a lot to help me do things the &quot;correct&quot; way in this environment. I whine and moan about this <em>all of the time</em> and they&#39;ve done a remarkable job of seeing through that and getting on and building stuff with me. (Did I mention I really hate ruby, and bundler, and rails? I do all the time in the office and on Twitter).</p>
<p>What I&#39;ve not done is tell them all how amazing they are, and sadly whining and being negative about the 5% often outweighs the other 95% of positivity so I&#39;m sticking the positive stuff up in this blog entry for everybody to see.  (No, I&#39;m not on commission)</p>
<h3>Featurist are great</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have a look at their <a href="https://github.com/featurist">Github</a>, this is not the standard .NET consultancy fare - they&#39;re out there <em>doing stuff</em> - both interesting and useful in a variety of technologies. They&#39;re busy having opinions and using those opinions to help companies build better software - it&#39;s pretty rad.</li>
<li>As far as temperament goes, I&#39;ve never met a group who have managed to mix being &quot;chilled out about things&quot; with &quot;we still care about software and building software&quot; in quite the way they have (Unlike me who have the latter but not the former to my detriment)</li>
<li>Quality? They&#39;ve got it - I might bitch about the rails monolith but truth be told this project is about 10000% better than most of the projects I&#39;ve ever come in onto this late in the game - and this is almost 100% down to the work of Featurist.</li>
<li>Culture? Easy going, keeping things mixed up (I made fun of them for moving desks every day but it keeps things interesting and the cynic in me be damned), focused on keeping processes lightweight but visible and shipping regularly - all those things that are easy to say and hard to do.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hire them</h3>
<p>If your company needs help (whether you&#39;re a start-up or established software house), you could do far worse than to get in touch with Featurist to see how they could help you - it&#39;s worth it.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>My state is... in a state</strong></p>
<p>My bullets subsystem is just a list of bullets, and I actually need more state to represent this.</p>
<p>So I had a little change to create a map which represented</p>
<ul>
<li>The bullets active within the scene</li>
<li>The time since we last fired a bullet</li>
</ul>
<p>Not too complicated:</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initBullets []
  {
    <span class="keyword">:lastFiringTicks</span> <span class="number">0</span>
    <span class="keyword">:active</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body">)</span></span>
  }
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Of course, this has made a bit of a mockery out of my bullets logic...</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> bulletsLogic [state]

  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>So much for that statement about Functional Programming forcing you to write code that is easy to reason about, a fool will write foolish code in whatever language ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Refactoring away from pain</strong></p>
<p>I can refactor this of course - now I know that there is an ability to &#39;modify&#39; a single field within a map with &#39;assoc&#39;, I can create functions that don&#39;t need to know about the whole state and have little sub-functions for handling the logic of my bullets system.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> bulletsLogic [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">tryAndFire</span><span class="body">
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">moveBullets</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>How about moving the bullets, and then passing whatever the state is after that point to the tryAndFire function, and then returning the state of that to the outside world?</p>
<p>Moving the bullets becomes a matter of calling assoc on each bullet with a modified y, this is much nicer than having to copy across each property of the bullet.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> moveBullets [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [bullets <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:bullets</span> state)</span></span>
        active <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:active</span> bullets)</span></span>]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> state <span class="keyword">:bullets</span> 
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> bullets <span class="keyword">:active</span>
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [bullet active]
          <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> bullet <span class="keyword">:y</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">dec</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> bullet)</span></span>)</span></span>)</span></span>
        )</span></span>
      )</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And trying to fire becomes a matter of adding an item to the list, or just returning original state</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> tryAndFire [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [bullets <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:bullets</span> state)</span></span>
        active <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:active</span> bullets)</span></span>
        player <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:player</span> state)</span></span>]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body">@keyStates <span class="number">32</span>)</span></span>
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> state <span class="keyword">:bullets</span> 
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> bullets <span class="keyword">:active</span>
          <span class="list">(<span class="title">cons</span><span class="body"> 
            {
             <span class="keyword">:x</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> player)</span></span>
             <span class="keyword">:y</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> player)</span></span>
             <span class="keyword">:w</span> <span class="number">5</span>
             <span class="keyword">:h</span> <span class="number">5</span>
            }
            active
          )</span></span>
        )</span></span>
      )</span></span>
      state
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Refactoring towards readability</strong></p>
<p> Of course this can be re-factored a bit further for readability by pulling out another function</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> tryAndFire [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body">@keyStates <span class="number">32</span>)</span></span>
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">fire</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
    state
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Keeping the activity of firing to its own little function</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> fire [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [bullets <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:bullets</span> state)</span></span>
        active <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:active</span> bullets)</span></span>
        player <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:player</span> state)</span></span>]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> state <span class="keyword">:bullets</span> 
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> bullets <span class="keyword">:active</span>
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">cons</span><span class="body"> 
          <span class="list">(<span class="title">initBullet</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> player)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> player)</span></span> <span class="number">5</span> <span class="number">5</span>)</span></span>
          active
        )</span></span>
       )</span></span>
     )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And yes, I also pulled out the code for creating a new bullet to make it even more obvious what is going on.</p>
<p>Now, actually because of my main logic function looking like this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> doLogic [state]
  {
    <span class="keyword">:direction</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">directionLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
    <span class="keyword">:enemies</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">enemiesLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
    <span class="keyword">:player</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">playerLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
    <span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">bulletsLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
  }
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I&#39;ve got to do some contortions to return &#39;just the bullets&#39; from my bullets logic</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> bulletsLogic [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">tryAndFire</span><span class="body">
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">moveBullets</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
  )</span></span>)</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Refactoring away from the acrobatics</strong></p>
<p>But how about taking my new pattern further and applying each sub-system&#39;s changes to the state as a sequence of modifications to the state</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> doLogic [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">bulletsLogic</span><span class="body">
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">playerLogic</span><span class="body">
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">enemiesLogic</span><span class="body">
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">directionLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
      )</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Overall I think I like this approach better than trying to make each system return its own state, and as most of the logic seems to require sections of state from all over the show having the state all readily accessible seems to make sense.</p>
<p>That said, I&#39;d normally shy away from this sort of approach in an OO language/manner because shared data implies coupling. </p>
<p>Of course my normal solution is often the duplication of state via events or some other in-direct means and the reason for this tends to be to avoid accidental mutation which isn&#39;t going to be such a problem here where it&#39;s such an explicit decision.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll see how that plays out as I roll forwards, but now I&#39;ve applied this refactoring step I&#39;m in a much better position to get in the feature I wanted in the first place. </p>
<p>If I end up not liking the current mutation capabilities, I can always change how I update the state from the outside-most part of my program by doing my assoc there. That mutation is such a visible decision in my code seems to be one of the bonuses of FP.</p>
<p><strong>Updating nested data with assoc-in</strong></p>
<p>I don&#39;t like all the nested assocs, so I hit up the Clojure docs now I&#39;m not on a plane and discover &#39;assoc-in&#39; and &#39;get-in&#39;, which do pretty much what you&#39;d expect.</p>
<p>Instead of</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> fire [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [bullets <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:bullets</span> state)</span></span>
        active <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:active</span> bullets)</span></span>
        player <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:player</span> state)</span></span>]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> state <span class="keyword">:bullets</span> 
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc</span><span class="body"> bullets <span class="keyword">:active</span>
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">cons</span><span class="body"> 
          <span class="list">(<span class="title">initBullet</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> player)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> player)</span></span> <span class="number">5</span> <span class="number">5</span>)</span></span>
          active
        )</span></span>
       )</span></span>
     )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I can actually do</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> addBulletInPlayerLocation [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [player <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:player</span> state)</span></span>]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc-in</span><span class="body"> state [<span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="keyword">:active</span>]
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">cons</span><span class="body"> 
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">initBullet</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> player)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> player)</span></span> <span class="number">5</span> <span class="number">5</span>)</span></span>
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">get-in</span><span class="body"> state [<span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="keyword">:active</span>])</span></span>
      )</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>So I&#39;ve done that everywhere it makes sense to as it makes the code more readable.</p>
<p><strong>Applying that time limiter</strong></p>
<p>So, what kicked off my re-factoring efforts was the addition of a little bit of state to my map ala</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initBullets []
  {
    <span class="keyword">:lastFiringTicks</span> <span class="number">0</span>
    <span class="keyword">:active</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body">)</span></span>
  }
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>How to use this? Well, the algorithm goes something like this</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">Is</span> <span class="built_in">last</span>Ticks nonZero? 
  Increase <span class="built_in">last</span>Ticks
  is <span class="built_in">last</span>Ticks equal to firing rate?
    Set <span class="built_in">last</span>Ticks to Zero

Are we trying to fire? 
  Yes? Is <span class="built_in">last</span>Ticks <span class="number">0</span>?
    Yes? Fire, increase <span class="built_in">last</span>Ticks</code></pre>
<p>So we have two steps</p>
<ul>
<li>UpdateFiringTicks</li>
<li>TryAndFire</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Managing the firing ticks</strong></p>
<p>Well first off, let&#39;s add this to the chain of logics we want to execute for our bullet logic</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> bulletsLogic [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">tryAndFire</span><span class="body">
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">updateFiringTicks</span><span class="body">
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">moveBullets</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And we can simply execute the logic described above here</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> updateFiringTicks [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [bullets <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:bullets</span> state)</span></span>
        ticks <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:lastFiringTicks</span> bullets)</span></span>]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">=</span><span class="body"> ticks <span class="number">0</span>)</span></span> 
      state
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">=</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">rem</span><span class="body"> ticks <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span> <span class="number">0</span>)</span></span>
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc-in</span><span class="body"> state [<span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="keyword">:lastFiringTicks</span>] <span class="number">0</span>)</span></span>
        <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc-in</span><span class="body"> state [<span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="keyword">:lastFiringTicks</span>] <span class="list">(<span class="title">inc</span><span class="body"> ticks)</span></span>)</span></span>
      )</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And firing just needs to update this value now so...</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> fire [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">incrementFiringTicks</span><span class="body">
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">addBulletInPlayerLocation</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> incrementFiringTicks [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">assoc-in</span><span class="body"> state [<span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="keyword">:lastFiringTicks</span>] <span class="number">1</span>)</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now my little craft only fires about once a second, mission accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This was quite a lengthy process to add a simple feature, I got side-tracked by what I hope was useful learning. I&#39;m left a little uncomfortable with how I&#39;m dealing with state and I feel like there is something more elegant I could be doing. Maybe I&#39;ll discover this as I continue through.</p>

<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">logic</span><span class="params">(state)</span> =&gt; <span class="title">newState</span></code></pre>
<p>Has been working great for me, but how might I manage a variable number of these entities? How might I hook up the creation of these entities to keyboard input?</p>
<p>Well, actually I don&#39;t think it is going to be that hard - but we&#39;ll see as I give it a go...</p>
<p><strong>The basics once again</strong></p>
<p>The same deal as everything else so far (okay, my next entry might be on re-factoring all this to avoid duplication)</p>
<p><em>This is how we create a bullet</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title"><span class="built_in">defn</span></span> initBullet <span class="collection">[x y w h]</span>
 <span class="collection">{
  <span class="attribute">:x</span> x
  <span class="attribute">:y</span> y
  <span class="attribute">:w</span> w
  <span class="attribute">:h</span> h
 }</span>
)</span></code></pre>
<p><em>Bullets logic is taking the current sequence of bullets and moving them on the vertical axis</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> bulletsLogic [state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [bullet <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:bullets</span> state)</span></span>]
    {
      <span class="keyword">:x</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> bullet)</span></span>
      <span class="keyword">:y</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">dec</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> bullet)</span></span>)</span></span>
      <span class="keyword">:w</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:w</span> bullet)</span></span>
      <span class="keyword">:h</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:h</span> bullet)</span></span>
    }
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p><em>And I&#39;m going to draw a black square for each bullet</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> bulletsRender [ctx state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">doseq</span><span class="body"> [bullet <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:bullets</span> state)</span></span>] 
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [{<span class="keyword">:keys</span> [x y w h]} bullet]
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">drawSquare</span><span class="body"> ctx x y w h <span class="string">"#000"</span>)</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>There is nothing special or new about the above, although I&#39;ve dropped the &#39;let&#39; (as compared to the enemies render function) and pulled the bullets out of the state as part of the doseq call.</p>
<p>My bullets to begin with?</p>
<p><em>Create an empty list</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initState []
 { 
   <span class="keyword">:direction</span> <span class="number">1</span>
   <span class="keyword">:enemies</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [x <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">16</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>
                  y <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">8</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>]
              <span class="list">(<span class="title">initEnemy</span><span class="body"> x y <span class="number">20</span> <span class="number">20</span>)</span></span>
   )</span></span>
   <span class="keyword">:player</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">initPlayer</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">200</span> <span class="number">430</span> <span class="number">20</span> <span class="number">20</span>)</span></span>
   <span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body">)</span></span>
 } 
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I found out how to do that on Google so I think it&#39;s right.</p>
<p>I also found out that apparently an empty list is not a sequence, although it is sequenceable which means I can safely do the above (I think)</p>
<p><em>Calling the appropriate methods</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> doLogic [state]
  {
    <span class="keyword">:direction</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">directionLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
    <span class="keyword">:enemies</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">enemiesLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
    <span class="keyword">:player</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">playerLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
    <span class="keyword">:bullets</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">bulletsLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
  }
)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> renderScene [ctx state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">enemiesRender</span><span class="body"> ctx state)</span></span>
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">playerRender</span><span class="body"> ctx state)</span></span>
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">bulletsRender</span><span class="body"> ctx state)</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now, all of this achieves the square root of diddly squat, although if I run the program it doesn&#39;t fall over in a heap pile of flames so that&#39;s pretty good going for all of this code.</p>
<p><strong>Hooking up some input events</strong></p>
<p>Well okay, for now what I&#39;ll do is say is &quot;if the spacebar is pressed we&#39;ll fire a bullet&quot;, so we can do this in a similar manner to everything else thus far...</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> bulletsLogic [state]</code></pre>
<p><em>Get the player out, and update the bullets into a seq called &#39;existingBullets&#39;</em></p>

          }

<p><em>If the space bar is down, then create a new sequence with a new bullet and the existing bullets</em></p>

         <span class="keyword">:h</span> <span class="number">5</span>
        }
        existingBullets
      )</span></span></code></pre>
<p><em>Else just return the existing bullets</em></p>
<pre><code>      <span class="title">existingBullets</span>
    )
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty messy, although it&#39;s my first iteration at this so that&#39;s okay, I suspect I can be a bit cleverer about this and probably will end up being so!</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t change the collection, create a new one</strong></p>
<p>What we can see though, is that I don&#39;t &quot;add the new bullet to the sequence&quot;, I instead &quot;create a new sequence out of the old one plus the new items&quot;. That&#39;s what <em>cons</em> does according to the Clojure docs.</p>
<p>This is counter-intuitive to those of us used to our mutable collections, but apparently Clojure is quite clever about this stuff and I should trust that this is okay. (Just like so far I&#39;m trusting that everything else is going to be okay too).</p>
<p>At some point soon I&#39;ll start reading about these sequences, collections, maps etc and see how they&#39;re implemented - now I have some &quot;real&quot; examples of their usage.</p>
<p><strong>The result</strong></p>
