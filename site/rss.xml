</ul>
<p>I mentioned in the <a href="/entries/learn-functional-programming-with-me---mutating-lots-of-state.html">last entry</a> that I was uncomfortable passing vectors around the place, because it means all of the functions that take in these vectors dependent on the <em>order</em> of information in these vectors and it&#39;s not at all clear what we&#39;re passing around.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been pointed in the direction of Maps and Records, and for now I&#39;ll start with Maps as they seem the most lightweight way of improving this situation.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at where we create our initial state first, as we&#39;ll refactor our way up from there.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initState []
 [
   <span class="number">1</span>
   <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [x <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">16</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>
         y <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">8</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>]
     [<span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> x <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> y <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span> <span class="number">20</span> <span class="number">20</span>]
   )</span></span>
 ]
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>What I&#39;m doing here is creating a vector that looks like this</p>
<pre><code>[ <span class="number">1</span> [<span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">0</span>] ]</code></pre>
<p>What is 1? What is the second vector? What is this nonsense?</p>
<p>How about returning a map instead of a vector from initState?</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initState []
 { 
   <span class="keyword">:direction</span> <span class="number">1</span>
   <span class="keyword">:enemies</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [x <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">16</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>
                  y <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">8</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>]
               [<span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> x <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> y <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span> <span class="number">20</span> <span class="number">20</span>]
   )</span></span>
 } 
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>So the difference is we&#39;re now using curly braces, and specifying key-value pairs for our values. (Bear in mind that this returned map is for all intents and purposes going to be immutable, so we haven&#39;t got to worry too much about exposing this state (I think)</p>
<p>Well actually, the rest of this is bit opaque as well, why not split out the enemy constructor into its own function?</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initEnemy [x y w h]
 [<span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> x <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> y <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span> <span class="number">20</span> <span class="number">20</span>]
)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initState []
 { 
   <span class="keyword">:direction</span> <span class="number">1</span>
   <span class="keyword">:enemies</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [x <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">16</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>
                  y <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">8</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>]
              <span class="list">(<span class="title">initEnemy</span><span class="body"> x y <span class="number">20</span> <span class="number">20</span>)</span></span>
   )</span></span>
 } 
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And if we&#39;ve gone that far, why not go further and make that a map as well?</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initEnemy [x y w h]
 {
  <span class="keyword">:x</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> x <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span>
  <span class="keyword">:y</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> y <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span>
  <span class="keyword">:w</span> w
  <span class="keyword">:h</span> h
 }
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now my data structure looks like this</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span class="method">direction:</span> <span class="number">1</span>
  <span class="method">enemies:</span> [
    { <span class="method">x:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">y:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">w:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">h:</span> <span class="number">0</span> },
    { <span class="method">x:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">y:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">w:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">h:</span> <span class="number">0</span> },
    { <span class="method">x:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">y:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">w:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">h:</span> <span class="number">0</span> },
    { <span class="method">x:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">y:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">w:</span> <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="method">h:</span> <span class="number">0</span> },
    // etc

  ]
}</code></pre>
<p>Bloomin&#39; marvellous. Now, this all still builds - although if I run it it&#39;ll fall over in disaster. This is because of mis-matched function calls, as I&#39;m passing these maps around and the functions are expecting vectors.</p>
<p>Type safety was mentioned in relation to Maps and Records and perhaps Records give me some of that, I&#39;ll look at those later if it becomes a burden.</p>
<p>I need to update functions where I&#39;m using these data structures (which is everywhere), so let&#39;s have a look how I&#39;ll do that:</p>
<pre><code>(defn tick [ctx state]
  (let <span class="string">[[dir enemies] state]</code></pre>
<p>Well, here is my first change, I&#39;m passing in &#39;state&#39; to &#39;tick&#39;, but the de-structuring assignment assumes that state is a vector and un-packs it accordingly, this is a valid operation against a map but is junk to my code so nothing happens.</p>
<p>Instead what I want to do is unpack the state I need from the map so I can use it.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> tick [ctx state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [enemies <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:enemies</span> state)</span></span>]</code></pre>
<p>Now, this is going to say, let &#39;enemies&#39; equal the result of the value found at the key :enemies, so this is how we access maps.</p>
<p>&#39;<em>enemies</em>&#39; is now a sequence of maps, and in order to render I&#39;ll have to un-pack that too if we&#39;re taking a direct approach to getting this code working again.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">doseq</span><span class="body"> [enemy enemies] 
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [{<span class="keyword">:keys</span> [x y w h]} enemy]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">drawSquare</span><span class="body"> ctx x y w h)</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, I&#39;m unpacking several keys from enemy at the same time using the special form &quot;:keys&quot;, that&#39;s kinda cool.</p>
<p>Our call to doLogic remains unchanged, as we merely pass in the state and expect the new state back in the same form.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">js/setTimeout</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">fn</span><span class="body"> []
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">tick</span><span class="body"> ctx <span class="list">(<span class="title">doLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>)</span></span>
)</span></span> <span class="number">33</span>  )</span></span></code></pre>
<p>However, the doLogic function expects a vector and does things with more vectors, so it&#39;ll need changing as well.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> doLogic [[direction enemies]]
  [
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">getNextDirection</span><span class="body"> direction enemies)</span></span>
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [[x y w h] enemies]
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"><span class="list">(<span class="title">=</span><span class="body"> direction <span class="number">1</span>)</span></span>
        [<span class="list">(<span class="title">inc</span><span class="body"> x)</span></span> y w h]
        [<span class="list">(<span class="title">dec</span><span class="body"> x)</span></span> y w h]
      )</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  ]
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I&#39;ll not bother un-packing here, at the moment everything needs all of the state, but I will split out the enemy logic into its own function for easier comprehension.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> doLogic [state]
  {
    <span class="keyword">:direction</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">directionLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
    <span class="keyword">:enemies</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">enemiesLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>
  }
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p><em>Now this is the old directionLogic</em>, we&#39;ll need to pull our enemies and direction out of our map.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> directionLogic [direction enemies]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">=</span><span class="body"> direction <span class="number">1</span>)</span></span>
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [right <span class="list">(<span class="title">apply</span><span class="body"> max <span class="list">(<span class="title">map</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">fn</span><span class="body"> [[x y w h] e] x)</span></span> enemies)</span></span>)</span></span>]
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"><span class="list">(<span class="title">&gt;</span><span class="body"> right <span class="number">600</span>)</span></span> <span class="number">-1</span> <span class="number">1</span>)</span></span>
    )</span></span>
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [left <span class="list">(<span class="title">apply</span><span class="body"> min <span class="list">(<span class="title">map</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">fn</span><span class="body"> [[x y w h] e] x)</span></span> enemies)</span></span>)</span></span>]
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"><span class="list">(<span class="title">&lt;</span><span class="body"> left <span class="number">0</span>)</span></span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">-1</span>)</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>So step by step</p>
<p><em>Our new signature and un-packing statement</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title"><span class="built_in">defn</span></span> directionLogic <span class="collection">[state]</span>
  <span class="list">(<span class="title"><span class="built_in">let</span></span> <span class="collection">[<span class="collection">{<span class="attribute">:keys</span> <span class="collection">[direction enemies]</span>}</span> state]</span></code></pre>
<p><em>We can pass in :x as the function to invoke (in this case the &#39;map&#39; operation will take :x out of each enemy)</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">=</span><span class="body"> direction <span class="number">1</span>)</span></span>

  )</span></span></code></pre>
<p><em>And the same for the other direction</em></p>
<pre><code>  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [left <span class="list">(<span class="title">apply</span><span class="body"> min <span class="list">(<span class="title">map</span><span class="body"> <span class="keyword">:x</span> enemies)</span></span>)</span></span>]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"><span class="list">(<span class="title">&lt;</span><span class="body"> left <span class="number">0</span>)</span></span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">-1</span>)</span></span>
  )</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I&#39;ll look at tidying this up in a moment, but first I want to sort out my enemiesLogic function and check that my code still works
and I still have moving yellow squares in my browser.</p>
<p><em>Our old enemies logic</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [[x y w h] enemies]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"><span class="list">(<span class="title">=</span><span class="body"> direction <span class="number">1</span>)</span></span>
    [<span class="list">(<span class="title">inc</span><span class="body"> x)</span></span> y w h]
    [<span class="list">(<span class="title">dec</span><span class="body"> x)</span></span> y w h]
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p><em>Well first off, we now have a function for this, so that looks like this</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title"><span class="built_in">defn</span></span> enemiesLogic <span class="collection">[state]</span>
  <span class="list">(<span class="title"><span class="built_in">let</span></span> <span class="collection">[<span class="collection">{<span class="attribute">:keys</span> <span class="collection">[direction enemies]</span>}</span> state</code></pre>
<p><em>But I&#39;m going to do something different here</em></p>
<pre><code>    func (if(= direction <span class="number">1</span>) <span class="keyword">inc</span> <span class="keyword">dec</span>)
   ]</code></pre>
<p>Rather than the old if statement, I&#39;m going to choose a function (called &#39;func&#39;) based on direction to create the new x with.</p>
<p><em>Creating the new list of enemies</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [enemy enemies]
  {
    <span class="keyword">:x</span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">func</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:x</span> enemy)</span></span>)</span></span>
    <span class="keyword">:y</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:y</span> enemy)</span></span>
    <span class="keyword">:w</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:w</span> enemy)</span></span>
    <span class="keyword">:h</span> <span class="list">(<span class="body"><span class="keyword">:h</span> enemy)</span></span>
  }
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>So here I copy the old state out of the old enemy, and make the new state with a modified x.</p>
<p>Hitting F5 in my browser</p>
<p><img src="/img/yellow_squares.png" alt="A load of yellow squares" title="Space invaders"></p>
<p>Success.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m slightly happier with maps, as it means the order in which I put data into these structures becomes irrelevant, my OO self is crying out though because I&#39;m passing around effectively property bags on which I&#39;m performing decisions and logic from.</p>
<p>It feels as if I&#39;m going to be repeating myself a lot if I have to keep addressing state this way, and hopefully I&#39;ll discover a better way as I progress, as this just feels like procedural code written in Clojure.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Mutating lots of state</strong></p>
<p>Thing is, what I can&#39;t do is pop into that sequence and start <em>changing</em> state, what I want to do each frame is (I think), create a <em>new</em> sequence and pass that into the next call of &#39;tick&#39;, <em>erk</em>.</p>
<p>Well, actually this shouldn&#39;t be such a big deal, how about creating a method that takes in a sequence and returns a new sequence where each item is slightly different from the original?</p>
<pre><code>(defn doLogic [enemies]
  (<span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="string">[[x y] enemies]
    [(inc x) y]
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>doLogic takes in a sequence of enemies, then uses a list comprehension to create a new list of enemies but with &#39;x&#39; increased by one.</p>
<p>Now all we have to do is pass this new sequence into the next call of &#39;tick&#39;</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">tick</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">doLogic</span><span class="body"> enemies)</span></span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Okay, that was <em>too</em> easy, from what I see here this is also going to be lazy up until the point we call &#39;doseq&#39;, it makes me feel kinda weird though that we&#39;re apparently creating a completely new sequence every single frame - memory-wise this has to be a bad idea and in the JS environment this is going to make me cry.</p>
<p>I have no idea what is going on under the hood though, so if any Clojurescript guru can enlighten me I&#39;d appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>Making our invaders move left to right and back again</strong></p>
<p>Well, the first thing I actually need to do is set up my invaders properly in some sort of known &#39;game space&#39;, this isn&#39;t really related to the functional programming bit so I&#39;m going to pretty much side-step over it by modifying the code and explaining what I&#39;ve done. (normally I&#39;d use a camera system and be a bit more clever, but not the point of this exercise)</p>
<p><em>The first thing I&#39;ve done is moved the ctx call outside of tick</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> ^<span class="keyword">:export</span> init []
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [ctx <span class="list">(<span class="title">context</span><span class="body">)</span></span>] 
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">tick</span><span class="body"> ctx <span class="list">(<span class="title">initState</span><span class="body">)</span></span>)</span></span> 
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And actually, I&#39;m going to specify the width and height as 640x480 and hard-code the whole thing</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> ^<span class="keyword">:export</span> init []
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [ctx <span class="list">(<span class="title">context</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">640</span> <span class="number">480</span>)</span></span>] 
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">tick</span><span class="body"> ctx <span class="list">(<span class="title">initState</span><span class="body">)</span></span>)</span></span> 
  )</span></span>
)</span></span>

<span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> context [width height]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [target <span class="list">(<span class="body">.getElementById js/document <span class="string">"target"</span>)</span></span>]
    [
      <span class="list">(<span class="body">.getContext target <span class="string">"2d"</span>)</span></span> 
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">set</span><span class="body">! <span class="list">(<span class="body">. target -width)</span></span> width)</span></span>
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">set</span><span class="body">! <span class="list">(<span class="body">. target -height)</span></span> height)</span></span>
    ]
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And now I&#39;ve done this, I can do a little bit of maths and say that if I make my space invaders 20x20, then I can fit 8 of them on the screen horizontally and 4 vertically (leaving space for our good guy and between them!)</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initState []
 <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [x <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">16</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>
       y <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">8</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>]
   [<span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> x <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> y <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span> <span class="number">20</span> <span class="number">20</span>]
 )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I&#39;m also now including a width and height with each of my little invaders, which means I&#39;ll need to modify my logic function</p>
<pre><code>(defn doLogic [enemies]
  (<span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="string">[[x y w h] enemies]
    [(inc x) y w h]
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>And rendering them now looks like this</p>
<pre><code>(doseq <span class="string">[[x y w h] enemies] (drawSquare ctx x y w h))</code></pre>
<p>Now this doesn&#39;t solve that what I want to do is change the direction of my squares when they reach the edge of the playing area, this is bit more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Variable state changes</strong></p>
<p>Well, when do my space invaders switch direction? Well, I went on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=437Ld_rKM2s">Youtube</a> to look at the original behaviour of space invaders and it seems that if you destroy a column of invaders then it won&#39;t switch direction until at least one invader has reached the edge of the screen.</p>
<p>What&#39;s an efficient way of handling this I wonder, well I&#39;ll need a direction as part of my main game state so I&#39;ll get that in first</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initState []
 [
   <span class="number">1</span>
   <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [x <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">16</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>
         y <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">8</span> <span class="number">2</span>)</span></span>]
     [<span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> x <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span> <span class="list">(<span class="title">*</span><span class="body"> y <span class="number">30</span>)</span></span> <span class="number">20</span> <span class="number">20</span>]
   )</span></span>
 ]
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Okay, so now initState will return a vector containing a direction (1), and a sequence of enemies. I&#39;m really not confortable with these arbitrary lists of state so I&#39;ll look for some way to make them tidier shortly I think.</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> tick [ctx state]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [[dir enemies] state]
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">clearScreen</span><span class="body"> ctx)</span></span> 
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">doseq</span><span class="body"> [[x y w h] enemies] <span class="list">(<span class="title">drawSquare</span><span class="body"> ctx x y w h)</span></span>)</span></span>
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">js/setTimeout</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">fn</span><span class="body"> []
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">tick</span><span class="body"> ctx <span class="list">(<span class="title">doLogic</span><span class="body"> state)</span></span>)</span></span>
    )</span></span> <span class="number">33</span>  )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In my tick method, I&#39;ll use a destructuring assignment to unpack this vector into a direction and an enemies sequence so I can easily go through that sequence.</p>
<pre><code>(defn doLogic <span class="string">[[direction enemies]]</span>
  [
    direction
    (<span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="string">[[x y w h] enemies]
      [(inc x) y w h]
    )
  ]
)</code></pre>
<p>And in my doLogic method, I&#39;ll simply re-return the diretion, and the modified sequence of enemies.</p>
<p>All I need to do now is return a different direction if a certain condition is true</p>
<ul>
<li>Are we going right? Are any of the entities too far to the right?</li>
<li>Are we going left? Are any of the entities too far to the left?</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, how about</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> doLogic [[direction enemies]]
  [
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">getNextDirection</span><span class="body"> direction enemies)</span></span>
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [[x y w h] enemies]
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"><span class="list">(<span class="title">=</span><span class="body"> direction <span class="number">1</span>)</span></span>
        [<span class="list">(<span class="title">inc</span><span class="body"> x)</span></span> y w h]
        [<span class="list">(<span class="title">dec</span><span class="body"> x)</span></span> y w h]
      )</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  ]
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We&#39;ll ask another function what the next direction is going to be, if the current direction is &#39;1&#39;, we&#39;ll inc x, anx if the current direction is not 1, we&#39;ll dec x.</p>
<p>I can implement getNextDirection like so, taking in current and enemies</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> getNextDirection [current enemies]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">=</span><span class="body"> current <span class="number">1</span>)</span></span>
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [right <span class="list">(<span class="title">apply</span><span class="body"> max <span class="list">(<span class="title">map</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">fn</span><span class="body"> [[x y w h] e] x)</span></span> enemies)</span></span>)</span></span>]
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"><span class="list">(<span class="title">&gt;</span><span class="body"> right <span class="number">600</span>)</span></span> <span class="number">-1</span> <span class="number">1</span>)</span></span>
    )</span></span>
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [left <span class="list">(<span class="title">apply</span><span class="body"> min <span class="list">(<span class="title">map</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">fn</span><span class="body"> [[x y w h] e] x)</span></span> enemies)</span></span>)</span></span>]
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">if</span><span class="body"><span class="list">(<span class="title">&lt;</span><span class="body"> left <span class="number">0</span>)</span></span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">-1</span>)</span></span>
    )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I can say, if we&#39;re going right, check out what the max x position is, and change direction if it&#39;s greater than 600, and vice versa if it&#39;s not.</p>
<p>This all works, my squares go from left to right and back again and keep bouncing around.</p>
<p><img src="/img/yellow_squares.png" alt="A load of yellow squares" title="Space invaders"></p>
<p>I have another question at this point, which is &quot;how many times is this list being iterated, should I be optimising this some how?&quot;</p>

<li><a href="/entries/learn-functional-programming-with-me---improving-my-workflow.html">Improving my workflow</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, if I want lots of squares I&#39;m going to have to look at some means of representing collections in Clojure and my searches take me to <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/seq">Sequences</a></p>
<p>To create a sequence, I can do something like this</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> createSeq []
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [x [<span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">3</span>]]
    x
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Which returns me a sequence containing 0 1 2 3, an important point here is (at least I think), is that this sequence is <em>lazy</em>, it has not been executed yet. </p>
<p>Now, my collection of invaders will actually be 2D, so what I can actually do is</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> createSeq []
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [x [<span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">3</span>] y [<span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">2</span> <span class="number">3</span>]]
    [x y]
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Which returns me a sequence containing lots of [x y] pairs, so [0 0] [0 1] [0 2] etc.</p>
<p>Of course, there are functions for me here, so I can make a range</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> createSeq []
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [x <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">100</span> <span class="number">10</span>)</span></span> 
        y <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">100</span> <span class="number">10</span>)</span></span>]
    [x y]
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Pretty nifty if I do say so myself, so what I can start with if I want to draw a grid of yellow squares is something like</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> initState []
 <span class="list">(<span class="title">for</span><span class="body"> [x <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">100</span> <span class="number">10</span>)</span></span>
       y <span class="list">(<span class="title">range</span><span class="body"> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">100</span> <span class="number">10</span>)</span></span>]
   [x y]
 )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And I can call my initial tick method, passing in this state</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> ^<span class="keyword">:export</span> init []
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">tick</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">initState</span><span class="body">)</span></span>)</span></span> 
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And then loop through this</p>
<pre><code><span class="list">(<span class="title">defn</span><span class="body"> tick [enemies]
  <span class="list">(<span class="title">let</span><span class="body"> [ctx <span class="list">(<span class="title">context</span><span class="body">)</span></span>] 
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">clearScreen</span><span class="body"> ctx)</span></span> 
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">doseq</span><span class="body"> [[x y] enemies] <span class="list">(<span class="title">drawSquare</span><span class="body"> ctx x y <span class="number">5</span> <span class="number">5</span>)</span></span>)</span></span>
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">js/setTimeout</span><span class="body"> <span class="list">(<span class="title">fn</span><span class="body"> []
      <span class="list">(<span class="title">tick</span><span class="body"> enemies)</span></span> 
    )</span></span> <span class="number">33</span>  )</span></span>
  )</span></span>
)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Note that I&#39;m able to expand the content of this sequence as part of the doseq call</p>
<pre><code>  (doseq <span class="string">[[x y] enemies] (drawSquare ctx x y 5 5))</code></pre>
<p>Gotta like that at least a little bit!</p>
<p>About this doseq, this doseq is <em>explicitly</em> created to allow for side effects, I could have done</p>
<pre><code>  (<span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="string">[[x y] enemies] (drawSquare ctx x y 5 5))</code></pre>
<p>But nothing would happen because this is lazy too - had my head scratching for a while on that one...</p>

<p>This is where I was up to last time:</p>

</ul>
<p>And the Github repo is here: <a href="https://github.com/robashton/clojure-spaceinvaders">github.com/robashton/clojure-spaceinvaders</a></p>
<p>I advise you pop back and read those if you&#39;re just tuning in, as I&#39;ve had to as well in order to start up again!</p>
<p><strong>Improving my workflow</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m writing this after I&#39;ve learned a lot about managing my workflow to keep myself interested in tasks, and I&#39;m writing this after writing a silly number of posts about writing an <a href="/entries/ometa-odata-odear---polishing-it-off.html">OData parser in OMeta</a>, which reminded me an awful lot of what functional programming was like, so I came back here.</p>
<p>So, what have I done to make my life easier with this Clojure malarkey?</p>
<p>Well, I want faster feedback, I don&#39;t want to have to keep spawning up Java and I don&#39;t want any manaul build process.</p>
<p>Here is what I came up with (I know there is a repl and stuff, but I honestly just want to get some Clojure written at this stage and this seemed nice)</p>
<p>I&#39;m using <a href="https://github.com/ibdknox/cljs-watch">cljs-watch</a>, and I&#39;ve written a Makefile that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="attribute">default</span>: <span class="string">build</span>
<span class="attribute">all</span>: <span class="string">build</span>

<span class="tex">build:
  cljsc game.cljs <span class="command">\
</span>      '<span class="special">{</span>:optimizations :simple :pretty-print true<span class="special">}</span>' <span class="command">\
</span>      &gt; ./game.js

develop:
  cljs-watch game.cljs <span class="command">\
</span>    '<span class="special">{</span>:optimizations :simple :pretty-print true :output-to "./game.js"<span class="special">}</span>'</span></code></pre>
<p>Hacky, but if I type &quot;make develop&quot;, I can get on and write code without having to worry about compilation so I&#39;m happier with life, now I just make changes and hit refresh and they&#39;re there.</p>
<p><strong>Reminding myself of where I was</strong></p>
<p><em>First off, I specify that I&#39;m sticking this all in the namespace &#39;game&#39;</em></p>

<p>Wow. There is a lot to (re)-take in here.</p>
<p>First off, some observations</p>
<ul>
<li>Dom interop is horrible</li>
<li>I remember now that I had state issues, I think I had that question answered on Github though, so we&#39;ll have a look at that next</li>
</ul>

  <blockquote>
    I keep an eye on StackOverflow/Github/etc and mentally tot up the popularity of all these JS frameworks...
  </blockquote>

<p><em>ooooh</em>, that&#39;s a good one that. If we&#39;re <em>really</em> going to say &quot;We use FrameworkX&quot; (and I advocate that you <em>never</em> do this, it&#39;s a silly thing to do), then let&#39;s at least look at some cold hard facts when doing so.</p>
<p>Except let&#39;s not just look at popularity, let&#39;s think about the support and education and how we could find some metrics to determine these things.</p>
<p>Here are a few assumptions I&#39;m making for this post to work</p>
<ul>
<li>StackOverflow is popular enough for the data to be representative (it&#39;s the de-facto place to ask programming questions)</li>
<li>The number of questions/un-answered questions is indicative of support</li>
<li>Github is popular enough for the data to be representative</li>
<li>The number of projects, and the number of stars on a project is indicative of popularity/use</li>
</ul>
<h1>Number of questions and unanswered questions on StackOverflow</h1>
<p>The Stackoverflow guys are amazing, and <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/queries">provide querying capabilities right there on their site</a>, which means I can get some numbers right off the bat for the various frameworks</p>

<p>Doing this meant I got all the questions with all the tags in the eco-system around that framework, and the data I want is</p>
<ul>
<li>How many questions are there?</li>
<li>How many of those questions have accepted answers?</li>
<li><p>How mant answers do we get on average per question?</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Framework</td><td>Questions</td><td>Answered</td><td>%</td><td>Average answers per question</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
    <tr><td>backbone</td><td>8863</td><td>5741</td><td>64.7%</td><td>1.42</td></tr>
    <tr><td>angular</td><td>5498</td><td>3401</td><td class="red">61.8%</td><td>1.32</td></tr>
    <tr><td>knockout</td><td class="green">5624</td><td>3917</td><td class="green">69.6%</td><td>1.31</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ember</td><td class="red">10086</td><td>6426</td><td>63.71%</td><td>1.63</td></tr>
</table>

</li>
</ul>
<p>This in itself is quite interesting, as it doesn&#39;t seem like there is a lot of difference between them - although there are a lot more questions about Ember than I was expecting. Knockout is at the top of the heap as far as accept-rate goes but that might be indicative of the .NET-centric community found on StackOverflow?</p>
<p>To get some sense of this data, we could do with looking elsewhere for some data...</p>
<h1>Framework popularity</h1>
<p>For this, we can head to <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> as that&#39;s where all sensible OSS projects are hosted these days. Let&#39;s have a quick look at some basic stats about these projects. They&#39;re all actively using Github to track issues from the look of things so we can gleam a little bit about them from this data.</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Framework</td>  <td>Stars</td> <td>Forks</td>  <td>Issues open</td>  <td>Issues closed</td>  <td>Pull requests open</td>   <td>Pull requests closed</td>
      </tr>
    </thead>
      <tr><td>backbone</td> <td class="green">14148</td>  <td class="green">2713</td>            <td class="green">23</td>             <td>2508</td>          <td class="green">5</td>      <td>1100</td>          </tr>

      <tr><td>ember</td>    <td>6997</td>                 <td>1324</td>                          <td>196</td>                          <td>2487</td>          <td class="red">61</td>       <td>1250</td>          </tr>
  </table>


<p>Backbone apparently by far the healthiest project amongst this bunch, with very few issues or pull requests left open (but with a similar amount of activity). I&#39;m surprised a more &quot;mature&quot; project like Angular has so much outstanding on it - but this might just be because of how they use Github issues.</p>
<h1>Safety in numbers</h1>
<p>This data (when combined with the previous queries) begins to get a little bit more useful if we want to jump to some conclusions already; I&#39;d like to dig deeper into the history of these projects and see who exactly has contributed to them. I don&#39;t want to be choosing a framework just because it has a large number of users, I care about who is doing the development too!</p>
<p>To do this, we have the Github API to look at </p>
<pre><code><span class="label">https:</span>//api<span class="preprocessor">.github</span><span class="preprocessor">.com</span>/repos/{user}/{repo}/contributors</code></pre>
<p>What do the contribution distributions look like for these projects?</p>
<h3>Top 10 contributors and their commit counts</h3>
  <div id="contribution-graph">

  </div>


<p>The higher a line stays before it drops down to the 1st, a better indication that there is a healthy spread of committers giving love to the project. By this measure, Angular and Ember seem to be getting some shared love, Backbone is a bit of a one man show and Knockout doesn&#39;t really have a lot going on.</p>
<h1>A brief history of source</h1>
<p>Now I&#39;m looking at committers, we can probably dig a bit deeper and see how this looks over time to get some further insight into the stability of the projects and how this contributor activity looks over time.</p>
<p>I was going to just paste the charts from Github here, but they weren&#39;t really representative of activity and the Angular one just plain-old-wasn&#39;t-working at the time</p>
<p>I&#39;ve found a git library for nodejs and will use it to generate a graph of activity over time. What you&#39;d expect to see is that older more stable projects should see a tendency towards less activity and hopefully more contributors as the community fixes issues)</p>
<h2>Average commits per person over time per repo</h2>
  <div id="contribution-over-time">

  </div>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>I&#39;ve got no real desire to draw conclusions off this data, as this was a harmless bit of digging over a spare few hours I had going, I do have some rough comments though:</p>
<ul>
<li>EmberJS has a third of the followers on Github to Backbone, a similar amount of activity on Github but <em>more questions on StackOverflow</em> - is this an indication as to it being hard to pick up or use? It also has a high amount of code churn still - presumably because it&#39;s still quite an immature project (I didn&#39;t realise how much younger it was than the others!)</li>
<li>Backbone is clearly reaching some sort of maturity, with few issues left open on Github, commit activity subsiding and some sort of stability being reached. It doesn&#39;t have the high number of core contributors of other projects but there are plenty of people willing to fix bugs still. The support rate on StackOverflow is about the same as the other projects and while it might be the most popular project on Github it doesn&#39;t have that many questions considering that huge size.</li>
<li>Knockout doesn&#39;t really get the love that other frameworks do, this might be due to its conception taking place in the .NET community or because most people steer clear of it for some reason. That said - if you&#39;re using it and asking for help on StackOverflow you&#39;re more likely to get help than on the other frameworks. The response rate on issues/pull requests is high which means the core contributors are quite active even if there aren&#39;t many of them.</li>
<li>Angular is <em>waaaaay</em> older than I thought it was, so it staggers me the amount of issues pending closure. It has a very solid contributor base and it does seem as though the commit-rate is reaching some sort of stability.  It does however have the lowest accept-rate on StackOverflow so read into that what you will. </li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m saying no more on the matter, trololol.</p>

<p>Although technically I am now a full-time <em>whatever</em> programmer at a start-up in London, writing all of the features in JavaScripts and inserting Cucumbers into my Rubies I&#39;m not <em>leaving</em> anything per se but I&#39;m probably not going to be doing many talks or blog posts for that ecosystem for the time being. (I haven&#39;t actually written any C# in months apart from a week or two at various clients, and the only time I&#39;ve booted up my Windows laptop for any other reason than that in the past year is to play Diablo III which is an awful game by the way)</p>
<h2>Apologies</h2>
<p>I&#39;m actually writing this post to apologise to anybody who hoped to see me at any of the conferences I&#39;m supposed to be speaking at over the next few months as I have cancelled these engagements.</p>
<p>I am devoting myself to a start-up, dropping my glamorous consulting and contracting lifestyle, ceasing my constant travel schedule and going to spend the majority of my time in London from now on (becoming UK resident once more, paying UK tax and renting an apartment here). I&#39;ll stop being able to reach into the infinite buckets of cash handed over in exchange for fractions of my immortal soul but hopefully I&#39;m going to be a part of something pretty big and exciting.</p>
<h2>The start-up life</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not going to write about who the start-up is here on my blog as the site is going a re-design at the moment; although folk who know me already know and it&#39;s not a secret. I&#39;m pretty enthused about what they are doing and believe it not only has a reasonable chance of success, but is being led by people who have a good idea of what they want to do with it and what they want to get out of it.</p>
<p>My role? Undefined, I&#39;m going to be writing code (and I have been writing code for the past couple of weeks for them), and looking to take more ownership of the codebase as we onboard new clients and encounter challenges come as a part of that.</p>
<p>This is the kind of stuff I&#39;m good at, writing code and delivering software and it&#39;s a genuine pleasure to be in a job where this is what is expected of me rather than hours of bullshit meetings and endless hand waving.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a bit scared about staying in one place for more than a few weeks, as I&#39;ve not done that for a while but this should be the start of a rather awesome adventure and I look forward to working out how to enjoy London as a tax paying resident.</p>
<p>Woop woop.</p>

<li>Looking at Kotlin - Wrapping it up</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inner classes</strong></p>
<p>So, inner classes, a feature that both Java and C# have and each with their own set of issues.</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Outer</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span> 
  <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">val</span> bar : Int = <span class="number">1</span> 
    <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Nested</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span> 
      fun foo() = <span class="number">2</span> 
    } 
  } </code></pre>
<p>   val demo = Outer.Inner().foo() // == 2</p>
<p>No biggy here, except in Java there is a problem with nested class as explained in <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2013/02/kotlin-m5-is-out/">this blog entry</a> </p>
  <blockquote>
    An inner class is a non-static nested class, i.e. it holds a reference to an instance of its outer. In Java nested classes are inner by default, and if you don’t want a reference to the outer, you make your class static. Sometimes it leads to memory leaks, when someone is holding a reference to an instance of an inner class without knowing that it also holds an outer instance.
  </blockquote>

<p>Kotlin&#39;s solution is to say that you can&#39;t do this</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Outer</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span> 
  <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">val</span> bar : Int = <span class="number">1</span> 
    <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Nested</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span> 
      fun doSomething() {
        println(bar)
      }
    } 
  } </code></pre>
<p>Instead you have to mark the inner class with &#39;inner&#39; to make this an explicit decision</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Outer</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span> 
  <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">val</span> bar : Int = <span class="number">1</span> 
    inner <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Nested</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span> 
      fun doSomething() {
        println(bar)
      }
    } 
  } </code></pre>
<p>I have a better solution, <em>get rid of inner classes</em>, they&#39;re crap anyway and don&#39;t just cause problems in software, but apparently cause problems with language design too. Problem solved.</p>
<p><strong>null and elvis</strong></p>
<p>Kotlin operates on the basis of things not being nullable by default, which is something I wholeheartedly support.</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> derpy : Pony = <span class="keyword">null</span></code></pre>
<p>This isn&#39;t allowed.</p>
<p>We&#39;re allowed to say we <em>want</em> a nullable object, by adding a question mark to things.</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> derpy : Pony? = <span class="keyword">null</span></code></pre>
<p>This is sensible, and can&#39;t be faulted.</p>
<p>Most legacy java APIs will return things that <em>can</em> be nullable, and in fact a lot of Java APIs do this in places where they really shouldn&#39;t. The compiler will complain about this though, so where I do</p>
<p><em>Compiler error</em></p>
<pre><code> var fileList = <span class="transposed_variable">files.</span>listFiles()
 var <span class="built_in">size</span> = <span class="transposed_variable">fileList.</span><span class="built_in">size</span>
 println(<span class="built_in">size</span>)</code></pre>
<p><em>Compiler success</em></p>
<pre><code> var fileList = <span class="transposed_variable">files.</span>listFiles()
 var <span class="built_in">size</span> = fileList?.<span class="built_in">size</span>
 println(<span class="built_in">size</span>)</code></pre>
<p>The elvis operator gets compiled down into</p>
<pre><code> <span class="keyword">var</span> fileList = files.listFiles()
 <span class="keyword">if</span>(fileList != <span class="keyword">null</span>) {
   <span class="keyword">var</span> size = fileList.size
   println(size)
 }</code></pre>
<p>This is a case where Kotlin &quot;fixes&quot; Java well, so I&#39;m not complaining.</p>
<p><strong>Ranges</strong></p>
<p>Syntastical sugar, but always a fan of this sort of thing</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">for</span> (i <span class="keyword">in</span> (<span class="number">1.</span><span class="number">.4</span>).reversed() <span class="built_in">step</span> <span class="number">2</span>) print(i) <span class="comment">// prints "42" </span></code></pre>
<p>I like this sort of thing, although it gets out of hand in languages like Ruby so I&#39;d watch this stuff cautiously.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern matching</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">when</span> (<span class="keyword">x</span>) { 
  <span class="number">1</span> -&gt; <span class="keyword">print</span>(<span class="string">"x == 1"</span>) 
  <span class="number">2</span> -&gt; <span class="keyword">print</span>(<span class="string">"x == 2"</span>) 
  <span class="keyword">else</span> -&gt; { <span class="regexp">//</span> Note the block 
    <span class="keyword">print</span>(<span class="string">"x is neither 1 nor 2"</span>) 
  } 
}</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>when (tuple) { 
  is <span class="comment">#(1, 2) -&gt; ... </span>
  is <span class="comment">#(val a, 3) -&gt; print(a) // binding a to the first element of the tuple </span>
  !is <span class="comment">#(*, 1100) -&gt; ... </span>
  <span class="keyword">else</span> -&gt; <span class="keyword">...</span> 
}</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;m a sucker for pattern matching constructs and I like this implementation because of how easy it is to declare those function literals.</p>
<p>Also, it does intelligent casting for you as well, cutting own on some of the cruft you&#39;d usually get with this sort of thing</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">strangeFunction</span><span class="params">(a : Any)</span> <span class="type">: Any</span> {</span>
  when(a) {
    <span class="keyword">is</span> Int -&gt;
      <span class="keyword">return</span> a + <span class="number">5</span>
    <span class="keyword">is</span> String -&gt;
      <span class="keyword">return</span> a + <span class="string">"5"</span>
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Nice</p>
<p><strong>Round-up</strong></p>
<p>The stated goals of Kotlin of &quot;fixing Java&quot; don&#39;t appear to have been met, there are holdovers from the language such as </p>
<ul>
<li>The same old Java build cruft</li>
<li>Over-complicated inheritance system</li>
<li>Inner class madness</li>
</ul>
<p>And then some new ones</p>
<ul>
<li>confusing function constructs</li>
<li>keyword heavy solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>It does &#39;fix&#39;</p>
<ul>
<li>Null</li>
</ul>
<p>And it does compile to JavaScript which means some interesting library targeting opportunities.</p>
<p>If I were &quot;fixing a problem like Java&quot;, it would be by removing features that people shot themselves in the foot with often and by adding a few pieces of sugar to make things more readable in places.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#39;t be by adding more key-words and more options for shooting yourself in the foot with, and it wouldn&#39;t be by defaulting to mutable and public :)</p>
<p>That&#39;s pretty much all I have to say from my day of Kotlin, there are probably more things in there but I&#39;ve got other stuff to do and not on the JVM!</p>

<li>Looking at Kotlin - Fun with functions</li>
</ul>
<p>You can have some real fun with functions in Kotlin, let&#39;s do a really basic one first:</p>
<p><em>Extension methods</em></p>
<p>Extension methods were exciting a few years ago when they came out in C# because they offered the possibility of creating new and innovative APIs. There is little harm in them being in Kotlin then!</p>
<p>An extension method on the StringBuilder class which when invoked adds a new line to the builder:</p>
<pre><code>fun StringBuilder<span class="variable">.newLine</span>() {
    <span class="keyword">this</span><span class="variable">.append</span>(<span class="string">"\n"</span>)
}</code></pre>
<p>Simple enough.</p>
<p><strong>Function literals</strong></p>
<p>Any sane language has a way of declaring functions as variables. In JavaScript functions are objects just like anything else so this <em>just works</em>, in C# this ability was added as an afterthought so it is a bit ugly and Java well... it&#39;s Java.</p>
<p>A function that takes in nothing and returns nothing in Kotlin looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="type">: () -&gt; Unit</span></code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to invoke this, we could do so very easily</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">function</span><span class="params">()</span></code></pre>
<p>Of course, we&#39;d have to define it first and that looks like this</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> : <span class="params">()</span> -&gt; <span class="title">Unit</span> = {</span>
  println(<span class="string">"Hello world"</span>)
}</code></pre>
<p>We can be implicit if we&#39;re combining declaration and definition so..</p>
<pre><code>var <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> = {
  <span class="title">println</span><span class="params">("Hello world")</span></span>
}</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;ve got very few comments about this, it&#39;s pretty simples and self explanatory.</p>
<p>A few examples to help with the next bits</p>
<p><em>A function take takes in a string and returns nothing</em></p>
<pre><code>var <span class="keyword">print</span> : (arg: String) -&gt; Unit = { (arg: String) -&gt;
  println(arg)
}</code></pre>
<p>or implicitly</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="built_in">print</span> = { (arg: String) -&gt;
  <span class="built_in">println</span>(arg)
}</code></pre>
<p><em>A function that takes in two numbers and returns their sum</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="comment">var</span> <span class="comment">sum</span> <span class="comment">=</span> <span class="comment">{</span> <span class="comment">(one:</span> <span class="comment">Int</span>, <span class="comment">two:</span> <span class="comment">Int)</span> <span class="literal">-</span>&gt; <span class="comment">one</span> <span class="literal">+</span> <span class="comment">two</span> <span class="comment">}</code></pre>
<p>All of this is pretty nice, although it takes quite a bit of practice remembering what the various forms are for declaring these functions, what threw me (if I understand) is the difference between these function literals and declared functions.</p>
<p>With the function literals, it <em>seems</em> as though the returned value is the last statement in the function</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> doubleUp = { (<span class="keyword">val</span>: Int) -&gt; 
  println(<span class="string">"do a thing"</span>)
  <span class="keyword">val</span> * <span class="number">2</span> 
}</code></pre>
<p>where as in the declared functions it looks like this</p>
<pre><code>fun doubleUp(<span class="keyword">val</span>: Int) : Int {
  println(<span class="string">"do a thing"</span>)
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">val</span> * <span class="number">2</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;m not sure I understand this, two different ways of defining functions (plus all the various options we have around being implicit/explicit about the various aspects of the function) made it quite confusing to pick this up and I haven&#39;t even gone through some of the examples I saw on the Kotlin website.</p>
<p><strong>Passing functions around</strong></p>
<p>Given the following two methods, I want to invoke applyAndPrint with an array and the doubleUp function</p>
<pre><code>fun doubleUp(value: <span class="built_in">Int</span>) : <span class="built_in">Int</span> {
  return value * <span class="number">2</span>
}

fun applyAndPrint(values: <span class="built_in">Array</span>&lt;<span class="built_in">Int</span>&gt;, modifier: (value: <span class="built_in">Int</span>) -&gt; <span class="built_in">Int</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">for</span>(i <span class="keyword">in</span> values)
    println(modifier(i))
}</code></pre>
<p>My first thought would be </p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">applyAndPrint</span><span class="params">(<span class="function_name">array</span>(<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">3</span>,<span class="number">4</span>,<span class="number">5</span>), double<span class="variable">Up</span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>But this doesn&#39;t actually work, which I find counter-intuitive - in fact I couldn&#39;t find a good way to do this other than</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">applyAndPrint</span><span class="params">(<span class="function_name">array</span>(<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">3</span>,<span class="number">4</span>,<span class="number">5</span>), <span class="tuple">{(x) -&gt; <span class="function_name">doubleUp</span>(x)}</span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>I&#39;m definitely missing something here but the docs didn&#39;t really help me out.</p>
<p><strong>Setting the context of these passed functions</strong></p>
<p>Okay, this is where things get a bit cooler in theory - what if we had some sort of context (a builder) with some state in it and we want to invoke these functions transparently on top of these state.</p>
<p>Understand that? Well done, I don&#39;t - but here&#39;s an example</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="id">Builder</span> (<span class="id">val</span> <span class="id">multiplier</span>: <span class="id">Int</span>) {</span>

    fun invokeStuff(action: (Builder.() -&gt; Unit)) {
        <span class="keyword">this</span><span class="variable">.action</span>()
    }

    fun multiply(value: Int) : Int {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> value * multiplier
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The important bit here is the way we&#39;ve declared the type of &#39;action&#39;</p>
<pre><code><span class="attribute">action</span>: <span class="string">(Builder.() -&gt; Unit)</span></code></pre>
<p>This is a function that returns nothing, takes in nothing but is invoked on an object of type &quot;Builder&quot;.</p>
<p>This means when we use this builder like so</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">var</span> builder = Builder(<span class="number">10</span>)
builder.invokeStuff({
  <span class="title">var</span> result = multiply(<span class="number">1</span>)
  println(result)
})</code></pre>
<p>The context of &#39;this&#39; has been set to the builder object and we can invoke functions declared within the builder.</p>
<p>Thing is, this context can be played with - consider that we can also create extension methods on types, let&#39;s say the Int type.</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="id">Builder</span> (<span class="id">val</span> <span class="id">multiplier</span>: <span class="id">Int</span>) {</span>

    fun invokeStuff(action: (Builder.() -&gt; Unit)) {
        <span class="keyword">this</span><span class="variable">.action</span>()
    }

    fun multiply(value: Int) : Int {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> value * multiplier
    }

    fun Int<span class="variable">.doStuff</span>(value: Int) : Int {
      <span class="keyword">return</span> value * multiplier
    }

}</code></pre>
<p>I can use this with</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">var</span> builder = Builder(<span class="number">10</span>)
builder.invokeStuff({
  <span class="title">var</span> result = <span class="number">1</span>.doStuff(<span class="number">50</span>)
  println(result)
})</code></pre>
<p><em>The scoping of extension functions</em></p>
<p>This is invalid code</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">fun</span> some<span class="variable">Function</span>() <span class="tuple">{
    <span class="keyword">fun</span> <span class="variable">String</span>.<span class="function_name">someOtherFunction</span>() <span class="tuple">{

    }</span>
}

<span class="keyword">fun</span> <span class="function_name">someStuff</span>() <span class="tuple">{
    <span class="string">""</span>.<span class="function_name">someOtherFunction</span>()
}</span></code></pre>
<p>The extension method isn&#39;t visible because it was declared inside a different function.</p>
<p>This is the valid version:</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">fun</span> some<span class="variable">Function</span>() <span class="tuple">{
    <span class="keyword">fun</span> <span class="variable">String</span>.<span class="function_name">someOtherFunction</span>() <span class="tuple">{

    }</span>
    <span class="string">""</span>.<span class="function_name">someOtherFunction</span>()
}</code></pre>
<p>The same goes for classes too, this is also invalid</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="id">someClass</span>() {</span>
    fun String<span class="variable">.someOtherFunction</span>() {

    }
}

fun someStuff() {
    <span class="string">""</span><span class="variable">.someOtherFunction</span>()
}</code></pre>
<p>The scope is shared outwards when we set the context of those function calls, and this was clearly thought about.</p>
<p><em>Infix calls</em></p>
<p>And here is another feature, we have infix calls for functions with only one argument so..</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">var</span> builder = Builder(<span class="number">10</span>)
builder.invokeStuff({
  <span class="title">var</span> result = <span class="number">1</span> doStuff <span class="number">50</span>
  println(result)
})</code></pre>
<p><strong>My feedback</strong></p>
<p>There are so many things we can do with these functions and the way we do this seems to change with context (which is also something we control - haha, see what I did there?)</p>
<p>There is also power locked up in this state of affairs, I just wish it wasn&#39;t so confusing.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see why there is a difference between function literals and declared functions (and if there isn&#39;t, I don&#39;t know why my examples work or why I&#39;m so confused about it).</p>
<p>Functions are functions are functions, or at least they should be. I should be able to just do</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">var</span> doSomething = fun(x: Int) : Int {

}</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">map</span><span class="params">(do<span class="variable">Something</span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>Being able to pass in/set the context of calls is quite interesting for a specific use case (builders), and I kinda like it - although it feels a bit like something we could abuse horribly (and in fact, in the workshop we did - this is valid Kotlin code)</p>
<pre><code><span class="comment">json</span> <span class="comment">{</span>
    <span class="comment">"name"</span> <span class="string">.</span><span class="string">.</span> <span class="comment">"Rob</span> <span class="comment">Ashton"</span>
    <span class="comment">"age"</span> <span class="string">.</span><span class="string">.</span> <span class="comment">5</span>
    <span class="comment">"address"</span> <span class="string">.</span><span class="string">.</span> <span class="comment">{</span>
        <span class="comment">"number"</span> <span class="string">.</span><span class="string">.</span> <span class="comment">444</span>
        <span class="comment">"line</span> <span class="comment">one"</span> <span class="string">.</span><span class="string">.</span> <span class="comment">"never</span> <span class="comment">you</span> <span class="comment">mind"</span>
    <span class="comment">}</span>
    <span class="comment">"family"</span>.<span class="comment">array(</span>
        <span class="comment">{</span>
            <span class="comment">"name"</span> <span class="string">.</span><span class="string">.</span> <span class="comment">"Gareth</span> <span class="comment">Ashton"</span>
            <span class="comment">"relation"</span> <span class="string">.</span><span class="string">.</span> <span class="comment">"brother"</span>
        <span class="comment">}</span>,
        <span class="comment">{</span>
            <span class="comment">"name"</span> <span class="string">.</span><span class="string">.</span> <span class="comment">"Suzanne</span> <span class="comment">Ashton"</span>
            <span class="comment">"relation"</span> <span class="string">.</span><span class="string">.</span> <span class="comment">"sister"</span>
        <span class="comment">})</span>
<span class="comment">}</code></pre>
<p>What I don&#39;t know is all the angles that are trying to be covered, so it&#39;s hard to tell why we&#39;ve ended up in a situation where there is so much to learn about functions.</p>
<p>If you need a page on &quot;<a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/Kotlin/This+expressions#Thisexpressions-Qualified">this ambiguiguity</a>&quot;, then probably you&#39;ve gone too far.</p>
<p>Like the other language features so far, it feels a bit like there were some cool features thought of, and then things got a little bit of hand as the edge cases were discovered.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like infix notation</li>
<li>I like being able to pass functions around</li>
<li>I like being able to make function literals</li>
<li>I like extension methods</li>
<li>I like the scoping of extension methods</li>
<li>I like having type safety in the above</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;d just make an effort to prune it back and make things a bit more cohesive. I&#39;d definitely take a look at context and try to avoid the need for pages explaining how to manage it. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/entries/looking-at-kotlin---a-few-notes-made.html">Looking at Kotlin - getting started</a></li>
<li><a href="/entries/looking-at-kotlin---classes-and-functions.html">Looking at Kotkin - Classes and Functions</a></li>
<li>Looking at Kotlin - Inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#39;ve established (at least in my brief foray), that Kotlin doesn&#39;t really fix one of the biggest problems in Java (and C#), which is the misuse of classes as mutable data bags being passed around by scripts.</p>
<p>One of the other big problems in Java is that a common way to fix problems with code you don&#39;t own is simply &quot;inherit from all the things and override all the things&quot;.</p>
<p>This is their version of monkey patching, but in practise ends up being even worse because there is a tendency to use this power for the re-use of re-usable things which need re-using because there are a few lines of code we could re-use if we squinted hard enough at it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not really a big fan of inheritance systems in any language; I <em>am</em> all for the notion of bringing in behaviours from other systems though. I prefer to do it via composition or in JavaScript just copying the methods over with the constructor function state.</p>
<p><strong>What does inheritance look like in Kotlin?</strong></p>
<p>Well, to begin with it looks just like it does anywhere else, although it allows for multiple inheritance too (which is an inevitable quagmire of complexity, let&#39;s see...)</p>
<pre><code>open <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Pony</span>(<span class="title">val</span> <span class="title">name</span>: <span class="title">String</span>) {</span>

}

<span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Unicorn</span>(<span class="title">name</span>: <span class="title">String</span>) : <span class="title">Pony</span>(<span class="title">name</span>) {</span>

}</code></pre>
<p>One of the good decisions made here is that at least classes are closed by default, which I know annoys a lot of people but I think if you&#39;re making APIs or framework code in this sort of language a closed-by-default approach makes sense.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to ignore this for now because it&#39;s the same old crap you&#39;d expect from any inheritance system.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we sometimes wants to &quot;inherit&quot;, isn&#39;t necessarily because we want state <em>and</em>behaviour, and in fact the multiple inheritance in Kotlin is only allowed in cases where we only want behaviour.</p>
<p>For this, we have the &quot;trait&quot; keyword, which defines an class which only has behaviour, and in this inheritance system you can inherit from one class and as many traits as you like.</p>
<pre><code>trait Speaker {
  fun SayHi() {
    println(<span class="string">"This is the best day ever"</span>)
  }
}

<span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Unicorn</span><span class="params">(name: String)</span> :</span> Pony(name), Speaker {

}</code></pre>
<p>I can&#39;t actually think of many cases where this would be something I&#39;d want to do, you can&#39;t give anything to that trait so it&#39;s basically a static utility bag at this point.</p>
<p>It gets interesting when we have the ability to create a composition system out of these traits</p>
<p><strong>Composable traits</strong></p>
<p>How about we a trait called Speaker like the above, and ponies and unicorns aren&#39;t derived from each other, let&#39;s make it look like this for now:</p>
<pre><code>trait Speaker {
  fun SayHi() {
    println(<span class="string">"This is the best day ever"</span>)
  }
}

<span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Pony</span><span class="params">(val name: String)</span> :</span> Speaker {

}

<span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Unicorn</span><span class="params">(val name: String)</span> :</span> Speaker {

}</code></pre>
<p>My ponies and unicorns now have a method called &quot;SayHi&quot; and I can invoke these like so</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">var</span> pony = <span class="type">Pony</span>(<span class="string">"Pinkie Pie"</span>)
<span class="title">pony</span>.<span class="type">SayHi</span>()</code></pre>
<p>This is great, except actually ponies and unicorns don&#39;t say things in quite the same way, and actually they all have different sayings.</p>
<p>Well how about creating a speaker which is pretty much an interface, and an implementation which says stuff based on some state:</p>
<pre><code>trait Speaker {
    open fun SayHi() {
        println(<span class="string">"herp derp"</span>)
    }
}

<span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">ConstSpeaker</span><span class="params">(val saying: String)</span> :</span> Speaker {
    override fun SayHi() {
        println(saying)
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>We can actually pass these in in the constructor of our ponies and unicorns like so</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Pony</span><span class="params">(val name: String, voice: Speaker)</span> :</span> Speaker  by voice {

}

<span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Unicorn</span><span class="params">(val name: String, voice : Speaker)</span> :</span> Speaker by voice {

}</code></pre>
<p>Which means we can do</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> dash = Pony(<span class="string">"Rainbow dash"</span>, ConstSpeaker(<span class="string">"I run faster than you"</span>))
<span class="keyword">var</span> celestia = Unicorn(<span class="string">"Princess Celestia"</span>, ConstSpeaker(<span class="string">"I'm the boss of all the ponies"</span>))</code></pre>
<p><strong>Good news everyone</strong></p>
<p>  <img src="/img/farnsworth.jpg" style="float: left;"></p>
<p>Well, we&#39;ve found something that in principle I really like about Kotlin.</p>
<p>This is one of the pleasant surprises I had when exploring Kotlin at the workshop, although it caused all of the people in my immediate vicinity (including myself) undergo confusion the first time we came to try and use it.</p>
<p>If we got rid of the crappy legacy inheritance system and forced this composition based approach my <em>word</em>, we&#39;d solve problems, we&#39;d solve a lot of problems.</p>
  <div style="float: none; clear: both;">

<p>Make the above a little less verbose and we could be onto a winner.</p>
<p>It feels as if the language designers haven&#39;t really designed at this point, they&#39;ve just thrown a load of stuff at the wall because inheritance is something that all Java developers want and given us a few bad ways of doing something as well as something that has the potential to make us write better Java.</p>
<p><strong>My feedback</strong></p>
<p>If I was taking tackling this whole &quot;improve Java&quot; problem, I&#39;d be looking at some of the awful Java being written out there and saying &quot;Hey, inheritance based approaches usually suck, can we make them better?&quot;, and I&#39;d still not have come up with that traits system.</p>
<p>The traits system is great, run with it - get rid of the others and you remove a crap load of complexity and show an opinionated way of building composable software.</p>
<p>No doubt there are some problems not immediately obvious with it, but I&#39;m not being paid to be a language designer, the JB guys are so... what are you waiting for? :)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/entries/looking-at-kotlin---a-few-notes-made.html">Looking at Kotlin - getting started</a></li>
<li>Looking at Kotkin - Classes and Functions</li>
</ul>
<p>What better place to start investigating Kotlin than classes and functions, the basic constructs in any Javariffic language.</p>
<p><em>Taking the &#39;ction&#39; out of function</em></p>
<p>What I immediately like about Kotlin that the hello world example (beyond the laborious exercise of getting it compiled) is really simple.</p>
<pre><code>fun main(args : Array<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">String</span>&gt;</span>) {
  println("Hello world")
}</code></pre>
<p>There are no import statements, I haven&#39;t had to create a containing static class with a static method etc, I&#39;ve not had to tell it where println is coming from and I haven&#39;t had to write &#39;function&#39; which makes it immediately 60% better than JavaScript and 260% better than Java.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how modules work in Kotlin yet, or how you&#39;d share these functions between projects (That means getting into some Javariffic cruft I imagine), but I&#39;m able to create other files in the project with more functions like so:</p>
<p><em>secondary.kt</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">fun</span> do<span class="variable">Something</span>() <span class="tuple">{
  <span class="function_name">println</span>(<span class="string">"I'm doing something"</span>)
}</span></code></pre>
<p>and call them from my other files ala</p>
<p><em>main.kt</em></p>
<pre><code>fun main(args : Array<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">String</span>&gt;</span>) {
  doSomething()
}</code></pre>
<p>Without dancing through any hoops so that&#39;s cool.</p>
<p>In JavaScript I&#39;d be using require statements for this, which is great because dependencies are made explicit and I can follow them manually. </p>
<p>In a tooling-oriented language like Kotlin we can rely on the intellisense to tell us where stuff came from so this makes sense. (Although it makes it less ideal for vimming it up)</p>
<p><em>Class action Kotlin</em></p>
<p>Classes are interesting in Kotlin, they&#39;re rather reminiscent of constructor functions in JavaScript</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Person</span>(<span class="title">age</span>: <span class="title">Int</span>, <span class="title">name</span>: <span class="title">String</span>) {</span>

}</code></pre>
<p>and to create it (notice the lack of a new key-word)</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">var</span> person = Person(<span class="number">27</span>, <span class="string">"Rob"</span>)</code></pre>
<p>However, we start to encounter differences almost immediately - let&#39;s try adding a function</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Person</span>(<span class="title">age</span>: <span class="title">Int</span>, <span class="title">name</span>: <span class="title">String</span>) {</span>
  fun sayHello() {
    println(<span class="string">"Hi, I am $name, and I am $age years old"</span>)
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Ignoring the string interpolation at this point (any good sane language has this good feature these days) age and name don&#39;t actually exist at this point, we have to declare them as fields in the class and to do this we do:</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Person</span>(<span class="title">age</span>: <span class="title">Int</span>, <span class="title">name</span>: <span class="title">String</span>) {</span>
  <span class="keyword">var</span> age = age
  <span class="keyword">var</span> name = name

  fun sayHello() {
    println(<span class="string">"Hi, I am $name, and I am $age years old"</span>)
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Or short-hand:</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Person</span>(<span class="title">var</span> <span class="title">age</span>: <span class="title">Int</span>, <span class="title">var</span> <span class="title">name</span>: <span class="title">String</span>) {</span>

  fun sayHello() {
    println(<span class="string">"Hi, I am $name, and I am $age years old"</span>)
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This feels a bit weird and unnecessary (if I understand it correctly), I&#39;m all for having to explicitly declare those properties if we want to access them externally but I don&#39;t see why we&#39;d be passing state in if we didn&#39;t want to use it.</p>
<p>Now we&#39;ve declared those as vars, we can access them externally too, because those vars are public and write-only by default.</p>
<pre><code>fun main(args: Array&lt;string&gt;) {
  var person = Person(<span class="number">27</span>, <span class="string">"Rob"</span>)
  println(<span class="string">"I can access <span class="subst">${person.name}</span> from here"</span>)
}</code></pre>
<p>We actually have an immutable key-word too, which is &#39;val&#39;, we can make read-only properties therefore with:</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Person</span>(<span class="title">val</span> <span class="title">age</span>: <span class="title">Int</span>, <span class="title">val</span> <span class="title">name</span>: <span class="title">String</span>) {</span>

  fun sayHello() {
    println(<span class="string">"Hi, I am $name, and I am $age years old"</span>)
  }
}</code></pre>
<p><em>Access control in classes</em></p>
<p>I&#39;m not a huge fan of public state in classes, so how do we make these things private?</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Person</span>(<span class="title">private</span> <span class="title">var</span> <span class="title">age</span>: <span class="title">Int</span>, <span class="title">private</span> <span class="title">var</span> <span class="title">name</span>: <span class="title">String</span>) {</span>

  fun sayHello() {
    println(<span class="string">"Hi, I am $name, and I am $age years old"</span>)
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, they&#39;re public by default, this is a weird design decision - if we were looking to correct the sins of badly written Java programs this is not how I&#39;d start.</p>
<p>In fact, the notion of data-only objects is baked right into Kotlin, this is a data-bag or struct in this language:</p>
<pre><code>data <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Person</span><span class="params">(val age: Int, val name: String)</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice the data key-word in front of class, theoretically this means that Kotlin will generate a toString and equals check for you (although this didn&#39;t work on my machine).</p>
<p><strong>What I&#39;d do differently</strong></p>
<p>There is a fundamental difference between data bags and objects, and I&#39;m fine with both of them existing. I don&#39;t think we even need all those key-words or constructs to make it happen. </p>
<p><em>Want private state in a behavioural object?</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Person</span>(<span class="title">age</span>: <span class="title">Int</span>, <span class="title">name</span>: <span class="title">String</span>) {</span>
  fun someBehaviour() {

  }
}</code></pre>
<p>That should be the default as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>
<p><em>Want to expose that state?</em></p>
<p>Make it explicit,</p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Person</span>(<span class="title">val</span> <span class="title">age</span>: <span class="title">Int</span>, <span class="title">val</span> <span class="title">name</span>: <span class="title">String</span>) {</span>
  fun someBehaviour() {

  }
}</code></pre>
<p><em>Want to expose that state as mutable?</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Person</span>(<span class="title">mutval</span> <span class="title">age</span>: <span class="title">Int</span>, <span class="title">mutval</span> <span class="title">name</span>: <span class="title">String</span>) {</span>
  fun someBehaviour() {

  }
}</code></pre>
<p><em>Want immutable value data bags?</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Person</span><span class="params">(val age: Int, val name: String)</span></code></pre>
<p>No behaviour = data bag. In fact, I&#39;d tolerate the data attribute in this case too although I feel that the more key-words a language has the less likely I am to want to use it.</p>
<p><em>I don&#39;t like lots of key-words</em></p>
<p>In fact, you know what? What&#39;s the difference between a function and an object? We&#39;ll cover some of this later but I don&#39;t really see why we need the class key-word at all, the above would be fine as</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">fun</span> Person(age: Int, name: String) {
  <span class="title">fun</span> someBehaviour() {

  }
}</code></pre>
<p>One of the reasons I quite like Clojure is that everything is just a function, and looking up how to do something is <em>always</em> a case of looking up an appropriate function - I&#39;ve just talked about some basic class functionality and I&#39;ve already had to go through 5 different key-words.</p>
<p>Reduce towards simplicity and have some opinions, that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying, I&#39;m a big fan of JavaScript&#39;s lack of features, I&#39;m actually a fan of Java&#39;s lack of features too, if we could just fix some problems in those languages then we&#39;d be great.</p>
<p>I feel with just what I&#39;ve shown here, we&#39;ve just made it even <em>easier</em> for Java developers to carry on <em>doing it wrong</em>, when there is actually a good opportunity to encourage them to go in a better direction with the code. </p>
<p>A default towards private and immutable would have been a logical choice and I don&#39;t know why this isn&#39;t the case.</p>
