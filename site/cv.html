    <div id="body"><h2>Rob Ashton - Curriculum Vitae</h2>

<p>A freelance software consultant focused on being a polyglot and sharing with others what I have learned. </p>

<p>Currently travelling Europe helping various clients deliver software either through review or hands-on fixing of problems. Also to be found speaking at international developer-focused conferences about automated testing, .NET web development, JavaScript and polyglot persistence. </p>

<p>I have a <em>lot</em> of experience in the .NET space, especially in ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC, but I seek to balance that by drawing in external influences from other communities as NodeJS and Ruby.</p>

<p>I am an effective deliverer of software, and can provide references from a number of sources if asked.</p>

<h2>Professional history</h2>

<p><strong>Present - Software Nomad</strong></p>

<p>I am currently travelling around the world and working for clients on an ad-hoc basis, taking the work in which I have a lot to learn for free and sustaining my travels by continuing to execute paid-for consultancy roles in areas where I already have a track record of expertise.</p>

<p>The goal of this is to vastly accelerate my learning and exposure to the many different ways of building software, this work has so far included building a start-up in a week, working on a database engine and placing myself in several diverse start-ups across the world.</p>

<p>Alongside this, I am blogging what I have learned at <a href="http://codeofrob.com">codeofrob.com</a> and carrying on my speaking engagements in Europe.</p>

<p><strong>March 2011 – December 2012 - Freelance</strong></p>

<p>I spent nearly two years providing my services as an independent consultant at McKinsey Solutions, a private company built up inside of the McKinsey &amp; Company incubator.</p>

<p>Designated as a "Technical Expert" (at the time, the highest technical position within the company), I was primarily engaged in delivering platform code and components (in both .NET and JS) for use across the suite of products offered by the company and providing ongoing architecural and technical support across these products (most commonly with regards to performance or security).</p>

<p>I was assigned to three projects over my time at McKinsey Solutions, primarily in leadership roles and responsible for the architecture and design of all deliverables.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A trusted security/authorisation system on top of Active Directory </p>

<p>This made heavy use of WCF, LDS, ADS and attempted to simplifly greatly the effort required to write secured software on top of our reporting stack.</p></li>
<li><p>The front-end platform/framework code</p>

<p>Despite not being familiar intimately with Silverlight (the last-gen UI for the reporting stack), I was brought in with the aim of improving quality in the project and investigating the myriad of performance issues they were facing at the time.</p></li>
<li><p>The migration path from this legacy Silverlight system to a more web-friendly system.  (NodeJS, ASP.NET MVC, a de-coupled client-server architecture built up around RESTful principles)</p>

<p>Designed from the ground-up, I was responsible laying out the technical vision for this project and communicating this to leadership. This was a challenging project involving lots of legacy software and large doses of pragmatism.</p>

<p>I helped put together many of the required building blocks before leaving to follow a different path. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Alongside this, I was engaged with a number of other clients providing support for their ASP.NET and JS needs.</p>

<p><strong>August 2008 – March 2011: Technical Lead (Group GTI)</strong></p>

<p>I ran a team of four developers; we built a product from scratch for large companies looking to manage their hiring
processes. I was responsible for the technical design and implementation of the whole product and for communication with the business to understand the functional requirements. We built this on top of an ASP.NET MVC stack, with NHibernate, C# and we used TDD for the vast amount of the work.</p>

<p>Before this I was on another web team at the company, building functionality for their high exposure public facing publication sites in ASP.NET.</p>

<p><strong>July 2007 – August 2008: (Freelance)</strong></p>

<p>Providing hourly contracted programming services to a number of companies, including DriveWorks my former
employer and SynergyWorks, an ISP based in Kent. This involved adding features to their licensing systems in C++/C# and automated management of web servers</p>

<p>Alongside this, I also went back into the university I earned my degree at; teaching students C++ and deliver software for several research projects in PHP, C# and C++.</p>

<p><strong>June 2006 – July 2007: Software Developer (DriveWorks Ltd)</strong></p>

<p>Hired to finish their DriveWorks 6 product - an automation suite using formulae to generate plans and diagrams in the CAD package SolidWorks - one of my main deliverables was the licensing system written in C++/C# against a third party component, and the addition of several key features to the front-end product itself.</p>

<h2>Other work</h2>

<p>I spend a lot of my free time working on my own projects - both as a way to improve my skills and also for enjoyment as programming is something I love doing. I also spend a lot of time learning and sharing with communities both at conferences and online.</p>

<p><strong>RavenDB</strong> <a href="http://ravendb.net">ravendb.net</a></p>

<p>RavenDB is a document database written on top of the ESENT storage engine and Lucene.NET, it is written entirely in C# and is looked after by Hibernating Rhinos – a company based in Israel. I contributed heavily towards its early feature-set, pairing with its technical lead in several hotel lobbies at conferences and over Skype and learning a lot about freeing myself from the constraints of the traditional relational database. </p>

<p>More recently I have travelled to Israel to work on several key features, the details of which are contained with-in my blog.</p>

<p><strong>PrimoJS</strong> <a href="http://github.com/robashton/primojs">github.com/robashton/primojs</a></p>

<p>PrimoJS is an open source HTML5 game engine I have developed in order to demo the principles of utilising modules to break-up large JavaScript codebases into manageable pieces.</p>

<p>This was in an effort to build something that I could use at 48 hour competition events, and something I could show to demonstrate the principles I have been successfully pushing into clients for the past two years.</p>

<p><strong>Hoverbattles</strong> <a href="http://github.com/robashton/hoverbattles">github.com/robashton/hoverbattles</a></p>

<p>After writing a multiplayer pong clone in JavaScript with WebGL and a NodeJS, I decided to apply what I had learned to writing a 3D multiplayer hovercraft battle game, written from scratch in JavaScript on both the front-end and back-end, this used WebSockets for ‘real-time’ communication and was the simplest 3D thing I could make with my limited 3D modelling skills. It was educational. </p>

<p><strong>48 hour games</strong></p>

<p>I have written many games at 48 hour coding competitions. This was in the aim of studying what it takes to <em>complete</em> software, and to further understand the trade-offs required when choosing features for a minimum viable product whilst keeping a reasonable level of maintainability for continued project velocity.</p>

<p>The experience gained here has been invaluble in the more real world of software development.</p>

<p><strong>Public speaking and workshops</strong></p>

<p>Over the past few years, I have been a regular speaker at events such as <a href="http://ndcoslo.com">NDC</a>, and <a href="http://oredev.org">Oredev</a>, travelling across Europe and speaking on subjects such as pragmatic software testing, web development in .NET, effective JS development and NoSQL.</p>

<p>I also provide workshops for a number of topics, primarily RavenDB and ASP.NET MVC.</p>

<p><strong>Blog</strong></p>

<p>I am a regular blogger at <a href="http://codeofrob.com">codeofrob.com</a>, and occasionally write for <a href="http://codebetter.com">codebetter</a> and <a href="http://altdevblogaday.com">altdevblogaday</a>.</p></div>
