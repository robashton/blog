              <p>This is not a preachy "Unit test everything" workshop, it is a pragmatic look at getting the most value from the time spent creating automated tests</p>
              <p>Price: 1500 Euros</p>
            </div>

              <h4>Workshop: Full stack testing</h4>

              <h4>Offering: Have me on your team for 2 weeks</h4>
              <p>I am not a hit and run consultant, have me come and build some software with your team and share my experiences with them (and vice versa)</p>
              <p>Cross-pollination is under-rated in our industry, this is one way of fixing that, at the end of this time period a report will be delivered with recommendations and learnings</p>
              <p>Price: 6000 Euros</p>
            </div>

              <h4>Offering: Have me on your team for 4 weeks</h4>
              <p>Like the 2 week offering, but really getting involved in the day to day operations of the software team</p>
              <p>This can result in a much more complete report at the end of this time period</p>
              <p>Price: 10000 Euros</p>

          <p>I have spent a lot of time travelling around and trading experience with software teams.</p>
          <p>I have also built and released a lot of software.</p>
          <p>I want to share my experiences with as many people as possible, and this is how I do it.</p>
          <p>The prices listed are indicative and negotiable depending on location, time and the relationship we have built.</p> <p> I am available for work across Europe and my availability is present in a public calendar found here: <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=robashtondeveloper%40gmail.com&ctz=Europe/Brussels">Google Calendars</a></p>
          <p>I prefer to run my workshops and do my work on-site, it's cheaper and (usually) easier for everybody involved</p>
          <p>The content to the right hand is pre-prepared and battle-tested, I can put together customised offerings on request</p>
          <p>E-mail me on <a href="mailto:robashton@codeofrob.com">robashton@codeofrob.com</a> and we can begin the conversation</p>
