      <h1 id="post-title">I worry too</h1>
      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2013-9-25</span></h6>
      <div id="post"><p>I have been asked (more than) a few times over the past year or so questions along the lines of</p>
<ul>
<li>How can you actually make a living without long term contracts</li>
<li>Don&#39;t you worry about not finding work?</li>
<li>What about failure? What if you find you&#39;re not good enough for a client?</li>
<li>Are you saving for your future? Don&#39;t you worry about that?</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes - a list of reasons why people would feel worried or stressed by being in my position at the moment, and you know what - these questions are pretty hard to deflect because...</p>
<h1>I do worry</h1>
<p>Oh I worry - I&#39;ve hedged my bets by lodging in a cheap room somewhere outside of London the past couple of months for a low amount of money, no deposit and no minimum term, I&#39;ve hedged my bets by not taking on anything too long term so I can always leave the country, I&#39;ve hedged my bets by making friends like a mad person in case somebody - anybody has some work to throw my way, but I still worry. I worry that I&#39;ve still not been able to open a bank account in the country where I am supposedly paying taxes and that means that the money I&#39;ve been earning is still a mysterious pool of which a pile belongs to the government but I&#39;m not able to work it out properly because it&#39;s intermingled between my company and myself.</p>
<p>I worry that I&#39;m not going to find enough work to pay for coffee <em>and</em> my rent, I worry that I&#39;m not going to be able to afford to follow through on my plans for next year (which is to go on holiday for a month or so again), I worry that I&#39;m not investing in my future, I worry that I&#39;m going to end up 60 and poor, I worry that I&#39;m not charging enough I worry that I&#39;m charging too much and I worry that I&#39;m not good enough to be doing what I am doing. I worry about the talk I&#39;m giving next and whether I&#39;m prepared enough for it, I worry that I&#39;m not even qualified to give that talk - I worry that when I open my mouth at a conference people are going to realise I&#39;m pretty much making it up as I go along as I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.</p>
<p>I worry about all of these things and more - and I worry about them even more when people start listing of these things to me as a question because it reminds me of my worries - because after all, I&#39;m living life pretty much on the edge and I&#39;ve not really got the big name that would guarantee me lots of lucrative enterprise consulting contracts. I worry that I should be marketing myself more instead of spending my spare time writing code that nobody really cares about and I worry that I market too much and people are going to get fed up of me asking for work.</p>
<h1>I don&#39;t let it consume me</h1>
<p>So yes - I worry, it&#39;ll come as a surprise to people who are even close to me because I wear a cocky know-it-all no-bullshit arrogant aura of confidence everywhere I go, and that&#39;s a marketing tool too because nobody wants to hire a quiet passive guy who sits in the corner and doesn&#39;t feel as if he has any answers.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t let the worry consume me, I tell myself that there are safety nets and I tell myself that I can always get a real job if I really need to (and oh man, I worry about this too because that&#39;d be long term commitment to staying in one place for more than a few weeks and I get cabin fever really easy these days). But I tell myself that there are safety nets anyway because the worst thing that can happen is I take a real job except actually that&#39;s not the worst thing because the worst thing that could happen is that my field of software development collapses and I&#39;m left without a job - okay that&#39;s a pretty real worry but I don&#39;t let that consume me either because I have work for the next few weeks booked up at least and that&#39;ll keep the food in my mouth.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t let the worry consume me because things have a way of working themselves out if you throw your hands in the air and admit defeat and ask for help from people who already have their crap sorted out.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t let the worry consume me because I&#39;d prefer to be writing code and I can&#39;t write code when I worry so I write code to push the worry away and only let the worry in when I&#39;ve got a spare 30 minutes and there is no power in my laptop and I have nothing better to do.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t let the worry consume me because I&#39;ve spent many years now putting myself into worrying situations and things haven&#39;t fallen apart yet. </p>
<p>Worry has proven itself to give me nothing in return for the space in the head that I afford it, and by refusing to acknowledge it and just press on with what I <em>want</em> to do regardless I&#39;ve found that I can get along just fine.</p>
<p>But don&#39;t make the assumption that I don&#39;t worry and I&#39;m not scared - it&#39;s just the things I worry and fear are privileged white male software developer things to worry and fear and I&#39;m lucky to be doing what I&#39;m doing and getting away with it.</p>
