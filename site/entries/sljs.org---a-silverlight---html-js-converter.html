      <h1 id="post-title">SLJS.org - a Silverlight - Html/JS converter</h1>
      <div id="post">
		<p>At NDC2011 I was chatting to some folk who work on various OSS projects about cool things we could potentially work on in the future, and the topic of a Silverlight -&gt; Web converter came up</p>

<p>TLDR: Click <a href="http://sljs.org">here</a> to see the demos, click <a href="http://github.com/robashton/sljs">here</a> to see the code, click <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sljs">here</a> to view the Google Group.</p>

<p>I had thought about this before, but it is only recently that an IL converter appeared up that I deemed fit for this purpose (<a href="http://jsil.org">JSIL</a>), and it is after this conversation I decided to put words into action</p>

<p>To this end, I have spent the past few weeks diving into the various concepts in Silverlight and spiking out implementations for converting them to make sure that the vast majority of what I wanted was actually possible</p>

<p>And that leads us to this, <a href="http://sljs.org">SLJS.org</a>, home to where I've gotten so far, with a couple of demos showing off what it can do. More to be added as we go along.</p>

<ul>
<li>Here is a basic example of an application in action: Hello World (<a href="http://sljs.org/output/HelloWorld/HelloWorldTestPage.html">Silverlight</a>, <a href="http://sljs.org/output/HelloWorld/index.html">HTML</a>)</li>
<li>And here is something demonstrating some more SL concepts: Calculator (<a href="http://sljs.org/output/Calculator/CalculatorTestPage.html">Silverlight</a>, <a href="http://sljs.org/output/Calculator/index.html">HTML</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Truth be told I'm largely doing this for fun and education at the minute, although I know a few people who actually want to use it - not to convert legacy projects, but to write new code in their familiar Silverlight world and have it work in a browser without requiring a plug-in.</p>

<p>I'm happy to support that, but it should be a community effort, rather than me blindly just working on features for the sake of it (although I have a little more of that left in me before I start taking on feature requests!)</p>

<p>So far the following has been implemented</p>

<ul>
    <li>Bootstrapping a converted Silverlight application in JavaScript
    </li><li>Responding to changes of the root UI element</li>
    <li>Rendering a control hierarchy from the root UI element</li>
    <li>Rudimentary Dependency Object and Dependency Property support</li>
    <li>Listening for changes on Dependency Properties to update styling</li>
    <li>Listening for changes on Dependency Properties to update content</li>
    <li>A templating system for customizing the output from each control</li>
</ul>

<p>On my immediate road-map (so in the coming week), I'll be working on:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Rudimentary data-binding support (A spot of MVVM coming up)</li>
   <li>Converting styles to CSS</li>
   <li>Going through System.Windows.Controls and creating the outline for them in JS</li>
   <li>Forcing some layout concepts into HTML from Silverlight</li>
   <li>A preliminary investigation into attached dependency properties</li>
</ul>

<p>I would totally appreciate some help/feedback/pointers for the direction of the project/cheering from the sidelines etc</p>

<p>The last one is important actually, if y'all tell me you find this interesting then I'll carry on working on it, if nobody gives a crap then when I get bored I'll stop :-)</p>

<p>But yeah, just joining the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sljs">Google Group</a> and helping me build a road-map would be a good start</p>
