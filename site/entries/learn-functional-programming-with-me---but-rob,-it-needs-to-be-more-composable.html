<p>Her most recent piece of feedback was</p>
  <blockquote>
    What strikes me about your code right now is that it&#39;s not very composable
  </blockquote>

<p>Well I have to admit I had no idea what she meant by this, although it was in reference to a problem I was highlighting myself of <em>I&#39;m passing too much data around</em></p>
<p>It turns out that this is pretty much what the FP guys mean when they say that code isn&#39;t composable.</p>
<p>Obeerne of the beautiful things about the way languages like Clojure make you build up code, is that the functions you write are supposed to be re-usable across very basic and well-known data structures.</p>
<h3>Composability and Types</h3>
<p><a href="http://clojure.org/sequences">Sequences</a> are probably the best structures to be operating on top of, maybe with some primitives as directives of how to operate on them. </p>
<p>User defined structures such as a &quot;vector&quot; probably come in next and then my big chunk of state as a hash... well that&#39;s the worst - especially if I&#39;m passing it around as one big thing all the time.</p>
<p>With that in mind, suddenly we have a use for defined data structures like records (something I have been putting off for a while), and perhaps I can begin to solve my awkward relationship with that big ball of state. Something I have been muttering about for the past few blog entries.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;ve read the <a href="http://clojure.org/datatypes">page on types</a> in Clojure and from what I understand it seems that deftype is for structures with no behaviour, and defrecord is for more OOP scenarios but there is also <a href="http://clojure.org/protocols">defprotocol</a> which is somehow related to both and will probably help me with my current data-ball-of-mud problem.</p>
<p>To further confound me, the docs have snippets like this in them</p>
  <blockquote>
  Protocols are fully reified
  </blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll need a dictionary and a copy of SICP to understand this and my brain is melting a bit so I go to find wine. Nice cool wine on a terrace overlooking St Pauls Cathedral and try to make sense of these docs a bit more.</p>
<h3>Composability and Space Invaders</h3>
<p>Starting at the other end of the problem - away from wordy confusion, it&#39;s very easy to see that there are some basic data types in my Space Invaders game and I have some basic operations over the top of them.</p>
<p>First up, I&#39;m passing &#39;rects&#39; all over the place, and a rect is defined as </p>
<pre><code><span class="title">x</span> : <span class="type">LHS</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> the rect
<span class="title">y</span> : <span class="type">TOP</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> the rect
<span class="title">w</span> : <span class="type">Width</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> the rect
<span class="title">h</span> : <span class="type">Height</span> <span class="keyword">of</span> the rect</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s the state, and there are some basic operations over the top of this - some which involve mutation and some which do not</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw it (no mutation of internal state) </li>
<li>bottom of the rect (no mutation)</li>
<li>RHS of the rect (no mutation)</li>
<li>move left/right/up/down (mutation - perhaps just &#39;move&#39;)</li>
</ul>
<p>From what I understand of the docs, I could probably get a lot done by defining a rect as a record, and exposing these as methods on that record, this might make some of the code easier to follow.</p>
<p>I could also use a protocol to describe two things as being &#39;collideable&#39; (a suggestion from my tutor), which is the Clojure equivalent to an interface if I understand correctly.</p>
<h3>No code here</h3>
<p>I&#39;ll leave the implementation of this to the next post, as this is quite a lot of data to digest and I highly recommend reading the above docs if you&#39;re following along with my learning.</p>
