      <div id="post"><p>As I write my Clojure and the related blog posts, I've been having them reviewed by <a href="http://twitter/bodil">@bodil</a> who is a proper functional programming neckbeard emacs type.</p>

<p>Her most recent piece of feedback was</p>

<p><blockquote>
    What strikes me about your code right now is that it's not very composable
  </blockquote></p>

<p>Well I have to admit I had no idea what she meant by this, although it was in reference to a problem I was highlighting myself of <em>I'm passing too much data around</em></p>

<p>It turns out that this is pretty much what the FP guys mean when they say that code isn't composable.</p>

<p>One of the beautiful things about the way languages like Clojure make you build up code, is that the functions you write are supposed to be re-usable across very basic and well-known data structures.</p>

<p>Lists and sequences are probably the best structures to be operating on top of, maybe with some primitives as directives of how to operate on them. </p>

<p>User defined structures such as a "vector" probably come in next and then my big chunk of state as a hash... well that's the worst - especially if I'm passing it around as one big thing all the time.</p>

<p>With that in mind, suddenly we have a use for defined data structures like records (something I have been putting off for a while), and perhaps I can begin to solve my awkward relationship with that big ball of state. Something I have been muttering about for the past few blog entries.</p>

<p>So, I've read the <a href="http://clojure.org/datatypes">page on types</a> in Clojure</p>

<p>I have an immediately obvious piece of state that I could </p></div>
