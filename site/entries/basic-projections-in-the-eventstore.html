      <h1 id="post-title">Basic projections in the EventStore</h1>
      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2013-4-29</span></h6>
      <div id="post"><p>Being able to <a href="/entries/pushing-data-into-streams-in-the-eventstore.html">shove events in and out</a> is great for our event sourced apps, but actually - if we have these streams, it&#39;s really useful to be able to consistently manipulate the events as they come in and either query those events or re-organise them so they can be queried.</p>
<p>To do this, we have the notion of projections, which are chunks of code that can be executed over a stream (with persisted state) as events are added to it. Now, in reality this isn&#39;t actually too different to what we&#39;d be doing outside the event store when building up view models, and I foresee lots of bad things being done by people are the line between these different ways of reading streams are blurred and fought over.</p>
<p>I&#39;m actually quite interested in these projections as a way of building up state for reports/charts, or re-partitioning into streams for different consumers - let&#39;s have a look how the most basic of these could work. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s say I&#39;ve got a few events in the general structure of</p>
<pre><code><span class="rules">{
  <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">EventType</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="string">"PonyJumped"</span>,
  Data: {
    Pony: <span class="string">"Derpy Hooves"</span>,
    Height: <span class="number">10</span>,
    Distance: <span class="number">13</span>
  }</span></span></span>
}</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code><span class="rules">{
  <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">EventType</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="string">"PonySpoke"</span>,
  Data: {
    Sentence: <span class="string">"This is the best day ever"</span>,
    Pony: <span class="string">"Pinkie Pie"</span>
  }</span></span></span>
}</code></pre>
<p>And I&#39;m putting all of these events into a single stream <em>ponies</em></p>
<p>Let&#39;s say that I&#39;ve thrown a few hundred thousand of these events through the event store and I want to know something really basic, like how many times the ponies in my world have jumped since time began.</p>
<p>There is a Web UI available for managing projections in the event store (by default available at 127.0.0.1:2113). This is still subject to change though so I&#39;ll just be describing the ideas behind this concept.</p>
<p>There are some attributes of a projection that we can choose when creating a projection via HTTP or the UI</p>
<ul>
<li>Name: This is the name of the projection, I&#39;ll use this to look up the state</li>
<li>Source: This is the code to be executed</li>
<li>Emit Enabled: Projections can emit (or link) events if this is enabled</li>
<li>Enabled: Is this projection going to run?</li>
</ul>
<p>My options</p>
<ul>
<li>Name: &quot;PonyJumpCount&quot;</li>
<li>Source: TBC</li>
<li>Emit Enabled: Leaving this false (we&#39;ll cover usage of this later)</li>
<li>Enabled: Yes please!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for the source, we&#39;ll start with the most basic projection which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">fromAll</span><span class="params">()</span>
  .<span class="title">whenAny</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>(state,event) <span class="tuple">{ 
     return null; 
  }</span>);</code></pre>
<p>Basically, we have to select which streams we&#39;re going to be reading our events from, that &quot;fromAll&quot; bit means we&#39;re going to be reading from all of the streams, I&#39;m going to go ahead and change that to &quot;fromStream&quot; and select our &quot;ponies&quot; stream.</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">fromStream</span><span class="params">(<span class="string">"ponies"</span>)</span>
  .<span class="title">whenAny</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>(state,event) <span class="tuple">{ 
     return null; 
  }</span>);</code></pre>
<p>How about that next bit &quot;whenAny&quot;, well we&#39;ve already matched which stream we want events from, well this is the bit we get to use to select which events from that stream we&#39;re interested in - &quot;whenAny&quot; just means &quot;all the events in the stream&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to go ahead and change that to a when, which takes in a map of the events we&#39;re interested in and the callback to process the event with (pattern-matching on the EventType)</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">fromStream</span><span class="params">(<span class="string">"ponies"</span>)</span>
  .<span class="title">when</span><span class="params">(<span class="tuple">{
    <span class="string">"PonyJumped"</span>: <span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>(state, event) <span class="tuple">{
      return null;
    }</span>)</code></pre>
<p>Now for that callback - we have &quot;state&quot; and &quot;event&quot;, the former being the state we&#39;re building up for this projection, and the latter being the event we&#39;re going to be adding to that state.</p>
<p>To begin with, we haven&#39;t actually got any state, but we can rectify that by chucking in an &quot;$init&quot; handler (anything starting with a dollar is something built in to the event store)</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">fromStream</span><span class="params">(<span class="string">"ponies"</span>)</span>
  .<span class="title">when</span><span class="params">(<span class="tuple">{
    $init: <span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>() <span class="tuple">{
      return <span class="tuple">{ count: <span class="number">0</span> }</span>
    }</span>,
    <span class="string">"PonyJumped"</span>: <span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>(state, event) <span class="tuple">{
      return state
    }</span>
  })</code></pre>
<p>And now, the actual bit of code for building up our projection</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">fromStream</span><span class="params">(<span class="string">"ponies"</span>)</span>
   .<span class="title">when</span><span class="params">(<span class="tuple">{
        $init: <span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>() <span class="tuple">{
           return <span class="tuple">{ count: <span class="number">0</span> }</span>
        }</span>,
        <span class="string">"PonyJumped"</span>: <span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>(state, event) <span class="tuple">{
          state.count += <span class="number">1</span>
        }</span>
  })</code></pre>
<p>If I hit save and navigate to</p>
<p><em><a href="http://127.0.0.1:2113/projection/PonyJumpCount/state">http://127.0.0.1:2113/projection/PonyJumpCount/state</a></em></p>
<pre><code><span class="rules">{
  <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">count</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">1337</span>
}</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>I get some wonderful state.</p>
<p>Well, that was very basic, next time we&#39;ll look at how we could generate one of these projections for each pony we have in our world.</p>
