      <h1 id="post-title">Frameworkless JS - an example</h1>
      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2013-11-5</span></h6>
      <div id="post"><p>I was at a client last week helping with some <a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a> stuff and helping out with some of their JS while I was at it.</p>
<p>What I am going to do is walk through a bit of code I wrote with a couple of the developers from the client to explore a particular set of questions that they had, and demonstrate some of the concepts around frameworkless JS and why it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;re-inventing the wheel&quot; as such.</p>
<p>The repo is actually <a href="http://github.com/robashton/look-ma-no-frameworks">here</a> if you want to skip my blathering and have a look without any context - but be aware that the code written is very focused on what questions were being asked by the developers at the client site.</p>
<p>I feel the conversation often gets too focused on the negative aspects of frameworks, rather than the positive experience to be had developing without one and for that reason I&#39;m really glad to have a tangible example to walk through to demonstrate the fun to be had over at this side of the fence.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-i-asked-for-">What was I asked for?</h3>
<p>The developers were working on a project which didn&#39;t have a lot of data-binding (but had some), and involved the coordination between several actors on page. They were wondering how I dealt with such scenarios and whether I would be open to using libraries like Knockout within a frameworkless context. They were also curious about how to handle multiple &quot;pages/views&quot; and how to re-use widgets/code across multiple applications and avoid building a monolith. </p>
<h3 id="what-did-we-build-">What did we build?</h3>
<p>It&#39;s not much when you look at it, we demonstrate </p>
<ul>
<li>How we can build feature/widget folders that could potentially become npm modules in their own right</li>
<li>How to compose our application&#39;s functionality around the dom</li>
<li>How we could manage event listeners when moving around the application</li>
<li>How this approach doesn&#39;t necessary preclude us from using more bulky libs like Knockout</li>
<li>How you can have multiple &quot;pages&quot; with back/forward navigationo</li>
<li>Some rules to keep things sane as the application grows over time</li>
</ul>
<p>A few different techniques were used across the code example for templating/content, this was simply to demonstrate that we had <em>options</em>, we&#39;ll discuss as part of this blog series what the standard approach might look like.</p>
<h3 id="the-features">The features</h3>
<p>Again not much, we have a list of customers who belong to various banks, and we want to filter those customers by their bank as well as dive into the customer&#39;s details. There is no &quot;write&quot; functionality, although this would just be a matter of presenting the customer within a form and posting it so not a stretch to extend the example.</p>
<p>### </p>
<p>I&#39;ll go over the code from the beginning and talk about the decisions/conversations had while doing this. It&#39;ll be fun.</p>
