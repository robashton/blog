</ul>

<p>Well, first off let's create the player</p>

<pre><code> :player (initPlayer 0 430 20 20)
</code></pre>

<p>Where</p>

<pre><code>(defn initPlayer [x y w h]
 {
  :x x
  :y y
  :w w
  :h h
 }
)
</code></pre>

<p>There are some similarities here between the player and the enemy, and perhaps I'll address that when I'm a position to tell how.</p>

<p>Now, I'll want to render that player, and I'm actually going to take the bold step of pulling out a render function so my main loop now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>(defn tick [ctx state]
  (clearScreen ctx) 
  (renderScene ctx state)
  (js/setTimeout (fn []
    (tick ctx (doLogic state))
  ) 33  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>Just keeping things tidy!</p>

<pre><code>(defn renderScene [ctx state]
  (enemiesRender ctx state)
)

(defn enemiesRender [ctx state]
  (let [enemies (:enemies state)]
    (doseq [enemy enemies] 
      (let [{:keys [x y w h]} enemy]
        (drawSquare ctx x y w h)
      )
    )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>Right, so now I have a player, I may as well render it</p>

<pre><code>(defn renderScene [ctx state]
  (enemiesRender ctx state)
  (playerRender ctx state)
)

(defn playerRender [ctx state]
  (let [player (:player state)]
    (let [{:keys [x y w h]} player]
      (drawSquare ctx x y w h)
    )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>And I'll need to copy it across to the new state each iteration</p>

<pre><code>(defn doLogic [state]
  {
    :direction (directionLogic state)
    :enemies (enemiesLogic state)
    :player (:player state)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing new here, this'll just give me an additional yellow square on my canvas...</p>

<p><img src="/img/player_added.png" alt="An additional yellow square on a canvas" title="The player has been added"></p>

<p><strong>Handling those input events</strong></p>

<p>Now I want to move it though, and this is where things are going to get fun, from what I can <em>imagine</em> off the top of my head (I'm currently sat on a plane at 35,000ft with no internet so I can't look anything up), my options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attempt to mutate player state directly as input events happen</li>
<li>Keep some mutable state around to indicate whether certain keys are currently down, and apply these modifiers as part of logic</li>
</ul>

<p>I think I'm going to opt for the second one and see how that plays out. It kinda makes sense to me in ignorant-land that isolating areas of mutable state from my (currently quite) clean program will be helpful.</p>

<p>This is pretty much what the structure will look like:</p>

<pre><code>tick (state) =&gt;
  inputs = getCurrentInputs()
  tick applyLogic(state, inputs)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have to care that behind that getCurrentInputs is some horrible interop with the browser and piles of mutability, and if I work out how to do it better later it should limit the area of change needing to be applied.</p>

<p>I can hook the events using the standard js interop, which looks like this</p>

<pre><code>(defn hookInputEvents []
  (.addEventListener js/document "keydown" 
   (fn [e]
    (setKeyState e.KeyCode true)
   )
  )
  (.addEventListener js/document "keyup" 
   (fn [e]

   )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so what now? I need to get this information to the game somehow, and actually - the information I want is "Is the key currently down", which is state I need to build up off those events.</p>

<p><strong>Up and Atom</strong></p>

<p>So I had to a bit of trawling to get this right, there is a notion of an "atom", in Clojure which is effectively a mutable object with some synchronisation over the top of it.</p>

<p>I've tried to avoid having any of this trickery yet, but this is somewhere I think going to need it.</p>

<p>So, an atom - I'm putting this into my 'global' scope (actually, it's namespaced into (ns game))</p>

<p><em>Define some state called keyStates, assign to it an atom (initial value is an empty map)</em></p>

<pre><code>(def keyStates (atom {}))
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if I want to access the value of keyStates, I can de-rererence it thusly</p>

<p><em>De-reference an atom</em></p>

<pre><code>@keystates
</code></pre>

<p>I also wanted to know how to "modify a single value of a map", for reasons that are about to become clear, the way to do this is</p>

<p><em>Create a new map, with a single property changed</em></p>

<pre><code>(assoc myMap :name newValue)
</code></pre>

<p>This function returns a new map which is the same as the old one, but with that value changed (Hey, this is quite useful!)</p>

<p>The final piece of my jigsaw is the ability to change the value of this mutable atom, to do this I can use 'swap'</p>

<pre><code>(swap! myAtom (fn [oldValue] newValue))
</code></pre>

<p>So how about that setKeyState function?</p>

<p><em>Set the new keyStates to be the same as the old keyStates, but with a new value for the current keycode</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn setKeyState [code, value]
  (swap! keyStates assoc code value)
)
</code></pre>

<p>Swap will call assoc, passing in the old state and the other args specified (hey, this is quite functional!)</p>

<p>Now I have a global state for my current input, which means I can ask questions of it and apply those answers to my state.</p>

<p><strong>Applying input to my square</strong></p>

<p>Well, I'll make a function whose job it is to take in the old state and return the new state and that seems to be working well for me so far.</p>

<pre><code>(defn playerLogic [state]

)

(defn doLogic [state]
  {
    :direction (directionLogic state)
    :enemies (enemiesLogic state)
    :player (playerLogic state)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>And in this, I'll work out from the input what to do to my state</p>

<pre><code>(defn playerLogic [state]
  (let [player (:player state)  
        left (@keyStates 37)
        right (@keyStates 39)
       ]
    (cond (= left true) (assoc player :x (dec (:x player)))
          (= right true) (assoc player :x (inc (:x player)))
          :else player
    )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>There is a whole lot to take where, but it boils down to</p>

<ul>
<li>Extract player from the state</li>
<li>Extract 'left' from the de-referenced keyStates (37)</li>
<li>Extract 'right' from the de-referenced keyStates (39)</li>
<li>Decide what new state to return based on this value</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's look at that last bit closer:</p>

<pre><code>(cond (= left true) (assoc player :x (dec (:x player)))
      (= right true) (assoc player :x (inc (:x player)))
      :else player
</code></pre>

<p>This is kinda equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>if(left) { }
else if(right) {}
else {}
</code></pre>

<p>The expressions on the RHS will be evaluated and returned if the LHS is true.</p>

<p>We've already looked at assoc, we recognise dec/inc and basically all I'm doing is saying, 'return a new player with x changed, here is the new value of x, it's a modification of the current x'</p>

<p>I bet there is a tidier way of doing this actually, maybe a built-in but I came up with</p>

<p><em>Please apply the specified function to the specified key in this map and return the result</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn applyMod [m k func]
  (assoc m k (func (m k)))
)
</code></pre>

<p><em>And in usage:</em></p>

<pre><code>(cond (= left true) (applyMod player :x dec)
      (= right true) (applyMod player :x inc)
      :else player
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Paint our player Red</strong></p>

<p>I said red square, and so far it's yellow, let's fix this problem.</p>

<pre><code>(defn drawSquare [[ctx width height] x y w h c]
  (set! (. ctx -fillStyle) c)
  (.fillRect ctx x y w h) 
)

(defn enemiesRender [ctx state]
  (let [enemies (:enemies state)]
    (doseq [enemy enemies] 
      (let [{:keys [x y w h]} enemy]
        (drawSquare ctx x y w h "#FF0")
      )
    )
  )
)

(defn playerRender [ctx state]
  (let [player (:player state)]
    (let [{:keys [x y w h]} player]
      (drawSquare ctx x y w h "#F00")
    )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>The drawing square function and repetition across my two types of entity still bugs me, but I figure I'll yet manage to tidy this up.</p>

<p><strong>The result</strong></p>

<p>See, it's <em>almost</em> Space Invaders already.</p>
