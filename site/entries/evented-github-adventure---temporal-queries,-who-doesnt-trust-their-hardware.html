<li>Temporal queries in the event store</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing <a href="/entries/evented-github-adventure---who-writes-the-sweariest-commit-messages.html">basic aggregations</a> is fairly easy, but actually one of the great selling points of the projections system inside the EventStore is how easy it is to do temporal queries.</p>

<p>What is a temporal query? Well the example that <a href="http://twitter.com/gregyoung">Greg Young</a> always uses is "look for all the events in Twitter where somebody mentions starbucks, coffee, and happy within five minutes of each other"</p>

<p>The clue there is "look for all the events", and we'll see why that is with this example.</p>

<p><strong>Git</strong></p>

<p>Git is great, it's great because it's a DCVS and we can do everything locally and push to a remote repo when we feel we're ready.</p>

<p>That said, some people don't do this, every commit is a push - maybe it's because they're not used to using a system where they can work offline, or maybe they're just paranoid because they're working on a laptop they don't trust.</p>

<p>Either way, this is a great example of a temporal query we could write.</p>

<p><strong>A query on Git</strong></p>

<p><em>"Find the instances of pushes within X minutes of each other from the same user and same repo", is there a trend across different languages for this kind of usage?</em></p>

<p>I would <em>not</em> enjoy doing this in a standard database, but that's neither here nor there, let's see what we have.</p>

<p>First off, the important question is "what is the unique combination we're looking for"</p>

<p>We care about <em>PushEvent</em>s for a unique <em>User</em> and <em>Repo</em>, so it makes sense that what we should do is <em>partition by UserAndRepo</em>  so we can easily keep state around per repo.</p>

<p><strong>Partition by uniqueness</strong></p>

<p>Here is how that might look:</p>

<pre><code>fromStream('github')
  .when({
    "PushEvent": function(state, ev) {
      var repo = ev.body.repo.full_name
      linkTo('pushesbyrepo-' + repo, ev)
    }
  })
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good, I now have a stream per repo called "pushesbyrepo-{reponame}" - now what?</p>

<p>Well, the key thing I mentioned above was that we're "looking for all the events where", this suggests that perhaps the thing we are looking for should be considered an event in its own right.</p>

<p>We can do this, we can for each of thse streams keep a note of when the last push was, and if we encounter another push within a certain time-frame, emit an event for this find of ours.</p>

<p><strong>Running a projection per generated stream</strong></p>

<p>How to run this for each stream? Enter fromCategory</p>

<pre><code>fromCategory('pushesbyrepo')
  foreachStream()
  .when({
    $init: // etc
  })
</code></pre>

<p>There is a built in projection in the EventStore that will automatically use the character '-' to sort a collection of streams into categories, and if we have</p>

<ul>
<li>pushesbyrepo-bob</li>
<li>pushesbyrepo-alice</li>
<li>pushesbyrepo-derpy</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll get three categories to iterate through (bob, alice, and derpy)</p>

<p><strong>Emit the events we're looking for</strong></p>

<pre><code>fromCategory('pushesbyrepo')
  foreachStream()
  .when({
    $init: function(state, ev) {
      return {}
    },
    "PushEvent": function(state, ev) {
      if(state.lastPush) {
        var newDate = new Date(ev.body.created_at)
          , lastDate = new Date(state.lastPush.body.created_at)
          , difference = (newDate.getTime() - lastDate.getTime()) / 1000

        if(difference &lt; 120) {
          emit('paranoidpushes', "ParanoidPush", {
            first: state.lastPush,
            next: ev
          })
        }
      }
      state.lastPush = ev
      return state
    }
  })
</code></pre>

<p>Seems legit, simply keep the last PushEvent around at all times, when we get a new one, check the difference and emit an event if it's less than X minutes. NICE</p>

<p>Running this, I now have a stream at </p>

<p><em>/streams/paranoidpushes</em> </p>

<p>So, how many paranoid pushes have I had in the time period I've been sampling over? (roughly three hours at time of writing)</p>

<pre><code>fromStream('paranoidpushes')
  .when({
    "$init": function(state, ev) {
      return { count: 0 }
    },
    "ParanoidPush": function(state, ev) {
      state.count++
    }
  })
</code></pre>

<p>And the result?</p>

<pre><code>{ count: 104533 }
</code></pre>

<p>Voila, that's an incredibly simply temporal query that just works and gives me the total number of pushes that happened within 2 minutes of each other to the same repository - and it's pretty easy too. We have two steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Push out events for each instance of some temporal correlation</li>
<li>Aggregate on those events to get the result</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have this, perhaps we can look at combining this data we have to work out how this strange use of git plays out across different language developers.</p></div>
