      <div id="post">
		<p>I will be speaking in Norway in June at the <a href="http://www.ndc2011.no/">NDC conference</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ndc2011.no"><img height="95" width="271" alt="" src="/images/internal_codeofrob_com/ndc2011_logo.jpg"></a><br>
</p>
<p>This is quite exciting for me, my experience of the northern european lot at <a href="http://oredev.org/2011">Oredev</a> was that they were all incredibly bright (Something to do with the cold weather maybe?), and while I am intending on attending that conference this year already (one way or another), the chance to go to another conference in the region is not one to be turned down</p>
<p>It also turns out that a lot of the people I know from the land of Twitter, London and other conferences will be going too, and I can't wait to drink some beers with them and catch up</p>
<p>The talks I'll be giving?</p>
<h2>Document databases and ASP.NET MVC</h2>
<p>The formal blurb is on the NDC website, but basically I'll be talking about how if you're coming from a background of using ORMs like NHibernate or EF4, how you can take what you've learned and apply it to document database usage in an ASP.NET MVC application</p>
<p>What's amusing for me about this one, is that once I'd used a document database in an ASP.NET MVC application, it actually changed how I used ORMs in my ASP.NET MVC applications too.</p>
<p>Simplicity is of course the aim of the day here, but I'll talk about some potentially complicated patterns that some people might feel more comfortable with if they're used to working in a particular way</p>
<p>So this will be a fun one, the talk will be largely agnostic when it comes to the document store we're actually using, and be applicable to both CouchDB and RavenDB (I guess begrudgingly Mongo as well, if you must)</p>
<h2>Introduction to RavenDB</h2>
<p>No conference should be without one of these right?</p>
<p>This will be a ground up introduction to what RavenDB is, the features it exposes and a quick look at the basic usage of it with the .NET API it ships with.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing everyone there, and hope we're able to fit in a sauna at some point (temporally, not physically, in case that needs clarifying)</p>
