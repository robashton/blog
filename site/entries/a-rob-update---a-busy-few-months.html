      <h1 id="post-title">A Rob Update - A busy few months</h1>
      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2013-9-23</span></h6>
      <div id="post"><p>I asked for short-term work, and people responded and the past couple of months have found me doing quite a bit of work in C# and JavaScript, as well as throwing together a puppet set-up for a client (with a vagrant dev environment), and spending a couple of weeks at a data analytics company learning Cascalog and building some pretty charts. (As well as delivering a few conference talks)</p>
<p>It has been a great few months, and as we near the end of September I find myself with a few surprising findings:</p>
<p><strong>I actually quite like working in an office</strong></p>
<p>While I strongly desire the <em>freedom</em> to work from coffee shops (especially on those mornings where I just want to put my head down and throw some code at the laptop), when given this freedom I&#39;ve actually ended up going into the client offices on a regular basis. I enjoy joking with people, drinking coffee with people and making friends with the team.</p>
<p>This has definitely made <em>me</em> feel a bit more flexible with regards to the kind of client work I&#39;m happy to pick up.</p>
<p><strong>two weeks isn&#39;t always enough</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been quite strict about taking work from clients that we keep it to very short term sprints of two weeks, with the idea that</p>
<ul>
<li>It encourages focus from the client - <em>what do you actually want from me?</em></li>
<li>It encourages focus from me - <em>I must ship it</em></li>
<li>It allows for me to get involved with a bigger variety of teams/technologies/products</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I feel as if I left a bit of a trail behind me at one of my clients when I handed over what I&#39;d done but hadn&#39;t spent sufficient time (with a very busy team) making sure everybody understood what I had done, how far I was through it and what work was still remaining.</p>
<p>I feel as if I should be more flexible about this and under the right circumstances I think I&#39;ll be happy to take on a greater duration of work providing the reasons for this are clearly discussed.</p>
<p><strong>Folk only get fragments of my opinion over the internet</strong></p>
<p>Folk! While I might rant about Angular/KO/Ember/etc not being <em>necessary</em>, and definitely advocate the use of small libraries over all-encompassing frameworks, I&#39;m still <em>happy to work with these technologies</em>.</p>
<p>The number of people/potential clients who I have had this conversation with has genuinely surprised me and made me realise I need to tone it down a little bit when on this subject or any other for that matter. &quot;<em>Oh, we have work but it&#39;s AngularJS so will you actually like it?</em>&quot; - I&#39;m actually pretty pragmatic about this subject and will <em>always</em> defer to the team when I&#39;m project hopping because it would be unfair for me force them into doing something unfamiliar and then fly away again!</p>
<p><strong>I really enjoy learning</strong></p>
<p>While I&#39;ve always learned stuff through the projects I persue both in and outside of work, it has never been an actual <em>goal</em> to learn anything. However - I&#39;ve really started actively trying to learn Clojure/functional programming and during my time at Mastodon realised that some basic stats knowledge might go a long way in the industries in which the technologies I&#39;m enjoying at present.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;ve signed up to the Coursera Statistics One course for the next few months and intend on following that through. It&#39;s an exciting notion that I can just click a button on the internet and then be attached to an online learning course in which I&#39;ll be taught new skills.</p>
<p><strong>Where am I going with this</strong></p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve got a few months now until the end of the year, and I&#39;m really enjoying doing what I&#39;m doing and I feel as if I&#39;m delivering real value to the clients I&#39;ve worked with so far. I want to plan out some work between now and the new year holidays that doesn&#39;t get in the way of my learning (statistics/clojure) and allows me to deliver some awesome things for people.</p>
<p>I think I&#39;d be happy to take on some longer term stuff (up to 6 weeks) for the right people, so please do get in touch if you have something. (Anywhere in Europe is good, I&#39;m also thinking I wouldn&#39;t mind getting out of London/England for a little bit too).</p>
<p>My hiring details can be found on my <a href="/hire.html">availability page</a>, just drop me an email at <a href="mailto:robashton@codeofrob.com">robashton@codeofrob.com</a> and we&#39;ll see what we can do together.</p>
