      <h1 id="post-title">Adding idle indexes to RavenDB</h1>
      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2013-2-12</span></h6>
      <div id="post"><p>As I mentioned <a href="/entries/working-at-hibernating-rhinos.html">yesterday</a>, I&#39;m currently doing a week or so of work at Hibernating Rhinos (more specifically on RavenDB).</p>
<p>One of the first things I was asked to look at was the indexing system in RavenDB, as there was a backlog of tasks and requests on these, which tie into each other in numerous ways.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t like working on more than one thing at once when I&#39;m Getting Things Done, and while it was tempting to jump right in and say <em>&quot;We need to do the feature where dynamic indexes can be turned off, deleted and compacted over time&quot;</em>, the task was broken up into a few discrete features - some which had been requested individually anyway.</p>
<p>That brings me to the first feature we added in the first few hours of starting work at the office, I sat down with <a href="http://twitter.com/ayende">@ayende</a> and added the capability for indexes to be idle.</p>
<h2>What does that mean? Why would we want to do it? </h2>
<p>In RavenDB, querying is cheap because the answers have already been pretty much worked out by the indexing process. The indexing process has to crawl over every document as they&#39;re added and run user-logic over those documents, this is a process that tends to be IO bound as well as using up a few CPU cycles.</p>
<p>Thus, the more indexes you have, the more work the database has to do during heavy write periods - and as some customers have many indexes and also undergo heavy write periods, it has been requested more than once that indexes be prioritisable - this feature is a big step in that direction. </p>
<p><img src="/img/idlewis.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Indexes on the server now have a new flag, &quot;Priority&quot;, which can take the following values (Normal | Idle | Forced), the idea being that the user can use the administration console to set indexes that aren&#39;t as important to not be run during busy write periods, and instead only be processed during idle time.</p>
<p>The forced flag? Well, I&#39;ll write about that tomorrow when I cover how idle indexes have been used to make auto-indexing a bit cleverer.</p>
