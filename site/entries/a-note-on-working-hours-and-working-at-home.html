      <h1 id="post-title">A note on working hours and working at home</h1>
      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2013-3-21</span></h6>
      <div id="post"><p>Yes yes yes, that whole <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/23/yahoo-working-remote_n_2750698.html">Yahoo thing</a>, whatever - there is more context to that story than "Banning working at home", although whether that is a solution to the problems is certainly up for debate.</p>

<p>I don't care about that, but it's what prompted Hadi to write <a href="http://hadihariri.com/2013/03/16/freedom-to-work/">this lovely article</a></p>

<p>I've been thinking about this a lot since <a href="/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html">quitting my job</a> last December, as I've been travelling around and working for various people I've also found myself being given a lot of freedom as to how I apply my hours.</p>

<p>I've come to realise a certain "maturity" when it comes to my working hours, I passionately disagree with <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-hours/">Zach Holman</a> where he describes being addicted to work and the line between work/life being heavily blurred as being a <em>good thing</em>(tm). That's total bullshit, and while you might have caught me doing that when I first started my career you will not find me doing it now.</p>

<p>Why not? Because there are <em>so many cool things to do</em> that aren't work - that's why.</p>

<p><strong>How I've found myself working when given freedom</strong></p>

<p>I've been rolling in at around 10am and then leaving once fatigue sets in and I feel that I'm no longer being <em>effective</em>. That can be any time between 4pm and 7pm on most days.</p>

<p>Yikes- that means on some days I've been working only 5 hours if you factor in lunch!!</p>

<p>However:</p>

<ul>
<li>Those five hours have been me dedicated to my task</li>
<li>Those five hours have been the most awake five hours of my working day</li>
<li>Coming in at 10am (ish) simply means I've woken up naturally rather than forced myself up at 7am</li>
<li>Leaving when I'm fatigued means I dont burn myself out so I can maintain a productive pace throughout this</li>
<li>I found myself doing a few hours on days off, presumable because I wasn't burned out from a week of pushing too hard</li>
</ul>

<p>It's hard to imagine that any of my clients these past four months would have any difficulty in <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/161185/robs-ravendb-sprint">describing</a> my output as "effective" or "productive"!</p>

<p><strong>Working together</strong></p>

<p>That said, core hours <em>are</em> useful, face time is useful, conversations are useful, communication is vital.</p>

<p>This is one of those matters in which good tooling <em>can</em> seriously help, enabling a combination of async communication such as Campfire, Flowdock, e-mail or IRC is vital in these circumstances. If your employees are working at home <em>and</em> they're not pulling their weight - then pulling them in isn't going to solve that problem. </p>

<p>Creating an environment in which your employees feel valued and free to apply their efforts how they see fit is not wasted effort, and I wish more companies would do that.</p>

<p>When I decide what I'm doing with regards to work (when summer hits), I find it hard to believe I'll be working at any company who is enforcing 9-5, or have some rigidly described "flexi-time" as part of their contract in an effort to seem cool. </p>

<p>I've had it with that sort of thing, this I know for sure. I love being an effective member of a team too much to put myself in a position where I feel obliged to sit in a seat for an no apparent reason ever again. (Future employers take note please)</p></div>
