      <h1 id="post-title">This week, let's create a start-up - Day 4</h1>
      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2013-3-18</span></h6>
      <div id="post"><p><strong>This post was written on Thursday</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s day 4 out of 5 and <a href="/entries/this-week,-lets-create-a-start-up---day-3.html">we pretty much have an end-to-end MVP</a> sorted out, (and a genuine surprise for me given the platform chosen!).</p>
<p>Today we decided we&#39;d concentrate on some of the more fiddly aspects of the job, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the workflow nailed for the desktop client</li>
<li>Adding per-customer partitioning to the system</li>
<li>Adding a HTML5 audio player to the public-facing system</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The desktop client</em></p>
<p>Authentication proved to be a stumbling block, we&#39;re using forms auth across the site which is pretty unfriendly. I was pretty against creating a whole set of new endpoints just for a desktop client when we had perfectly good forms available for it already but I also didn&#39;t want to waste ages faffing with custom auth.</p>
<p>We had a look at creating a separate deployment for the desktop services using WebAPI but that would have meant doing a load of the infra work already achieved for ASP.NET MVC in WebAPI (yeah, they&#39;re kinda united and divided at hte same time). This would have been faffing, so we looked at...</p>
<p>Hosting WebAPI inside the ASP.NET MVC system and going for both Basic Auth and Forms Auth, we found a project on Github which federated these two with some custom providers - but that looked like it was going to be a rabbit hole too - and I&#39;m against faffing so we looked at...</p>
<p>The original idea of using the original forms, and issuing tokens to the desktop client ala <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>, this only took 20 minutes or so and proved to be the sane choice for rapid <em>moving on</em></p>
<p><em>Per customer partitioning</em></p>
<p>We actually already had a conversation about this, do we do database-per-client or just field-on-the-document, this is a classic debate and it&#39;s not much different in the document database world.</p>
<p>We decided that database-per-client would have been a nightmare faff of session management (shared database as well) - not to mention fun-times if it came to a clouded instance of Raven so lumped our bets in with the database-field.</p>
<p>We looked at hooking the events exposed by the RavenDB client to add the field check to all queries, but unless we wanted to manipulate the final string query this was a dead end (and it didn&#39;t seem like there was an easy way to hook the load/save process either). </p>
<p>This is either an omission on our parts, or RavenDB doesn&#39;t have those APIs yet, I really want those APIs, so I might add those APIs later, moving on however because we haven&#39;t got time for that...</p>
<p>I&#39;m not particularly proud of what we did next, but it worked, everywhere the system asked for IDocumentSession, we changed it to ISecureDocumentSession and exposed the 5 methods on Session that we&#39;re actually using </p>
<pre><code>- Load<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">Type</span>&gt;</span>(string id)
- Load<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">Type</span>&gt;</span>(int id)
- Load<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">Type</span>&gt;</span>(string[] ids)
- Query<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">Type</span>&gt;</span>(string id)
- Store(Object doc)</code></pre>
<p>In each of these we check for typeof T === ISecured, and apply a check for the OrganisationId of the document.</p>
<p>This took all of 5 minutes, and was an effective use of time, perhaps to be re-visited in the future if it doesn&#39;t pan out.</p>
<p><em>Complicated logic</em></p>
<p>However, we now have quite a lot of complicated behaviour around </p>
<ul>
<li>What organisations does the user have permission over</li>
<li>What organisation is the user currently administering</li>
<li>What organisation is being requested by the public facing system</li>
<li>What organisation is being pushed to from the desktop client</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of this logic exists in the infrastructure, and it needs pulling out and unit testing separately - just as a way of documenting the different functionalities exposed by these varients as changes are going to be very time consuing and error-prone otherwise.</p>
<p>This is an example of what <a href="/entries/uncle-bobs-viewpoint-considered-harmful.html">I was talking about in my testing post</a> about diving in when things became too hard to juggle.</p>
<p><em>The HTML5 Audio player</em></p>
<p>&quot;This&#39;ll be easy&quot;, I said, &quot;We&#39;ll just download a widget&quot; I said. We plumped for <a href="http://www.jplayer.org/">jPlayer</a>, which has a few dependencies including jQuery - so it&#39;ll have to be hosted inside an iframe so as not to annoy the site we&#39;re embedding the public data in.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t that easy though, first off - our data is in S3, and our public site is on somesubdomain.truthvine.com, cross site calls aren&#39;t really allowed...</p>
<p>Actually, they are - turns out that S3 has CORS support these days and on enabling that I was able to hear My Bloody Valentine blaring out of my speakers when visiting the player page in my Chromium install.</p>
<p>The same went for our IE10 instance and our IE9 instance but IE8...? Nope.</p>
<p>After faffing around trying to put the static files on S3 and going to-and-fro a tad, it turned out we&#39;d just mis-typed the path to the SWF file (which will handle CORS for us in crappy browsers) and now we have a cross-browser and cross-platform audio player on the site.</p>
<p>This is the classic example of where faffing costs time, and what I was trying to avoid throughout the day with the other decisions we had.</p>
<p>Trying to build quick, and practising building quick gives you instincts on avoiding these and I&#39;m glad that with the other challenges so far we&#39;ve managed to avoid faffing. </p>
<p>I guess browser compatability is always gonna be one of those things, but it only took an hour or so and leaving with all of the above achieved in a single day made us feel pretty good :)</p>
<p>Tomorrow time for some more features before I head back off to London and have a couple of days rest before heading to Greece for another coding adventure...</p>
