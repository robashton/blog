		<p>Nothing much to say here really,&nbsp; I’m a reasonably competent .NET developer, have been working as a technical lead at the current place creating a new product that is due to pop any time now, it wasn’t what I wanted to do in the first place (although that discussion belongs in the pub over several beers) and I’ve only stuck it out as long as I have because:</p>  <ul>   <li>I can be a bit stubborn about trying to make things work</li>    <li>I have been a big wuss</li> </ul>  <p>I have three months notice to ride out and a <em>lot</em> of responsibility to handover, I would be happy working as a full time developer (lead or otherwise) for the right company, would possibly be happier contracting and moving around a bit – but am open to suggestions as to where my life should next lead me. </p>  <p>Please contact me via my form or on twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/robashton">@robashton</a>&nbsp; if you have any suggestions/offers/requests for CV or whatever. There might be a delay in responding due to the deluge of good will I’ve already received from so many.</p>  <p>I am happy to relocate to most corners of the world or even tele-commute so please don’t hesitate to get in touch :)</p>  <p>Here is to the new adventure, assuming I actually find anything…</p>  <p>PS: It has been pointed out that I’m doing a lot of travelling and talking and educating at the moment and future employers might not be so accommodating of that – bonus points if you can be supportive about that!</p>
