      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2013-4-25</span></h6>
      <div id="post"><p>I pulled the <a href="http://geteventstore.com/">EventStore</a> out a while ago to play with, with the intention of making a cool Github InfoGraph type thing, it never quite materialised thanks to the rate limits imposed by Github, and then other stuff came up (like I've got a game engine I'm working on and I want to blog about!)</p>

<p>That said, I had some downtime this week in between engagements and decided to bring it up again and blog about some of the things I did with it and some of the questions we're able to ask with the projections feature (which is hitting a point of maturity now which it didn't have before).</p>

<p>Anyway, setting up the EventStore on my Debian install sorta looked like this</p>

<ul>
<li>Do a fresh build of Mono 3.0.5 (it won't work on the 2.10 that ships out of the box)</li>
<li>git clone the event store</li>
<li>checkout the projections branch (not out yet)</li>
<li>xbuild EventStore.sln</li>
<li>Build the v8 stuff</li>
<li>Set up LD<em>LIBRARY</em>PATH so the v8 stuff can be loaded from the .NET exe</li>
</ul>

<p>Coolio, so we'll assume that this is running throughout my little experiment and that I can access it on http://127.0.0.1:2113</p>

<p>Browsing to that URL, we can see a veritable playground of shinies, the most important for me are</p>

<ul>
<li>See All Streams</li>
<li>Projections</li>
</ul>

<p>Popping into the "See all Streams", we can see a big pile of json, what's cool about this is </p>

<ul>
<li>It's a pile of links</li>
<li>The links tell us what types are accepted</li>
<li>I can request this in various types as well (see the ?format=json) in this URL</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, it's AtomPub, and AtomPub is used across the EventStore for interactions - which means no faffing around with custom formats or any of the crap associated with a lot of proprietary systems.</p>

<p>Anwyay, I haven't currently got any info in my event store so I guess I'll look at that next...</p></div>
