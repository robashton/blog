      <h1 id="post-title">Testing in JavaScript</h1>
      <div id="post"><p>I'm a fan of writing automated tests for my applications and libraries. While I'm not particularly good at it, I've been through various thoughts and feelings about testing over the years, from TDD hardliner or even simply just writing tests for all the things, or writing tests around larger research spikes so I can bring them in as real code and refactor (gasp), writing tests from the functional requirements, outside in, dropping down when needing to, etc etc.</p>

<p>I'm going to try and avoid assumptions about personal testing style in this post, and just assume that we just have some code that you want to write tests for, even going so far as to ignore whether that code was written before or after - it has no bearing on the fundamentals and tooling we might use, and trying to claim a single method as The Way only leads to trouble anyway</p>

<p>I've been writing a lot of JavaScript lately, most of it isomorphic in nature, but some of it is specifically written for the server and some of it specifically for the browser. Each of these areas tends to come with its own challenges, in this post I hope to document some of the things I've learned along the way (and perhaps more learned people can teach me some more once they've read my post :)).

<h4>Testing goals</h4>
<p>When writing tests, I have a few goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My test suite needs to run everytime I save a file</li>
  <li>My test suite needs to validate whether my JavaScript is even valid JavaScript</li>
  <li>My test suite really needs to run in under a second or so</li>
  <li>My test suite should reduce the friction of refactoring, not increase it</li>
  <li>Every test in the suite should be useful</li>
  <li>Tests should describe what they're testing, not necessarily how they're doing it</li>
</ul>

<h4>Automated Validation</h4>

<p>Most of the above goals are common between JavaScript and the other languages I work with on a daily basis, but basic code validation is interesting - as it isn't an immediately obvious part of your automated test suite. JavaScript is notoriously easy to make mistakes in (although as you write more of it, you stop doing this) - and it's useful to be running validation tools over codebase as a partial replacement for the compilation stage in those languages which support it</p>

<p><strong>JSLint</strong>: I don't personally use JSLint for a few reasons, but a lot of people do so it's worth pointing out its existence if you decide it's the right tool for you. The basic goal behind JSLint is that Douglas Crockford of the Good Bits has encoded the helpful rules against common gotchas into a code scanner which also validates basic syntax. Declaring vars elsewhere than the top of the local function scope? <strong>Boom</strong>. Accidently creating global variables? <strong>Boom</strong>.
