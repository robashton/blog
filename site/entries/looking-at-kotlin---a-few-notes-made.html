      <h1 id="post-title">Looking at Kotlin - a few notes made</h1>
      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2013-5-16</span></h6>
      <div id="post"><p>I ended up (because of jetlag) waking up at 4am and deciding to book myself in for that day&#39;s <a href="http://kotlin.jetbrains.org/">Kotlin</a> workshop being ran by everybody&#39;s favourite sarcastic <a href="http://jetbrains.org/">Jetbrains</a> employee <a href="http://twitter.com/hhariri">@hhariri</a>. (Much to his surprise and irritation no doubt :))</p>
<p>I made a few remarks as the day went by about things I didn&#39;t like, and as one might think I was being a bit negative, I decided to take notes and write up some of my thoughts on language decisions I&#39;d found interesting for one reason or another.</p>
<p><strong>So what IS Kotlin</strong></p>
<p>Well this is the easiest bit really, it&#39;s another language that runs on the JVM that isn&#39;t Java. Any language that isn&#39;t Java is fine by me, and having already got the JVM installed for my (temporarily) abandoned Clojure efforts last year setting up wasn&#39;t too hard.</p>
<p><strong>What is its purpose?</strong></p>
<p>This is the first thing everybody (including myself) asks, and my understanding is that </p>
<ul>
<li>Java is crap</li>
<li>Clojure is too hard for the common developer to pick up and be effective in</li>
<li>Ditto Scala</li>
<li>Some of the ideas in the above languages are still appealing</li>
<li>the JVM has a good eco-system and is appealing to work with</li>
<li>Having a language that is easy to use but has some nice features and is on the JVM is also appealing</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s a simplification, it might just be that Jetbrains has a lot of spare R&amp;D cash and is throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks ;-)</p>
<p><strong>What did I use to play with it?</strong></p>
<p>I did what I normally do when pulling down something new, I opened vim and tried to write hello world in it.</p>
<p>Sadly, (and one might say as you&#39;d expect from a tooling oriented company), the docs/support for the compiler is sub-optimal and I wasn&#39;t able to run any of the jars I created using their command line tools.</p>
<p><em>One of the many attempts I had at doing command line kotlin</em></p>
<p>  <img src="/img/command_line_kotlin.png" title="Command line failure"></p>
<p>The best advice for &quot;getting started on the command line&quot; was to &quot;install ANT&quot; and &quot;write some XML&quot; and I figured if I was going to go down that route then I should just get with the program and use IntelliJ. Hopefully this will change in the future, I hate being told what to use to do my work and I hate tooling-oriented eco-systems.</p>
<p>I installed IntelliJ which thankfully was a simple matter of downloading a tar.gz and executing a shell script (it&#39;s all written in Java). I got some warnings because I&#39;m using OpenJDK out of principle but that doesn&#39;t seem to have caused me any issues.</p>
<p>Installing the Kotlin plug-in was easy (there is a nice plug-in manager), and I managed to install a vim plug-in too (although it&#39;s a bit dodgy at times, especially when trying to leave any of the editing modes)</p>
<p><strong>What did I find out when writing hello world</strong></p>
<p>Well, I had to get Hadi to fix my IntelliJ set-up because things weren&#39;t working right from the beginning (installing the Kotlin plug-in wasn&#39;t enough) and it seems some of the confusing cruft in the JVM is still present when it comes to working out what the program entry point is, and all that class/jar/nonsense that I never really understood.</p>
<p><em>Getting started</em></p>
<p>  <img src="/img/idea_start.png" title="confusing"></p>
<p>This is the stuff I&#39;m talking about, I ask to create a &quot;Java Module&quot; (and I&#39;m not really sure what this is) and then after setting up some Kotlin stuff I get a big folder full of all sorts of xml and jar files in it and at some point I get to create the single kotlin file I really wanted. This is one of the reasons I never really liked tooling like Visual Studio/etc - there is a big surface area of potential problems here and I don&#39;t know what is really going on. </p>
<p>One of the great things like Clojure and its eco-system has done, is hide a lot of this crap away so I <em>can</em> just write some code in a file and compile/execute it. If we&#39;re going to make Java less sucky, this is a must.</p>
<p>Hello world is quite simple, once you get past the mess of files above:</p>
<pre><code>fun main(args : Array<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">String</span>&gt;</span>) {
  println("Hello world")
}
</code></pre><p>The syntax is quite explanatory, and the main(args/etc) stuff is just a convention that the tooling knows means this is an entry point. It takes about 15 seconds to compile on my MBA and in this lies another annoyance.</p>
<p>15 seconds to run hello world means 15 seconds to run my tests, means 15 seconds for a feedback loop <em>before even writing any code</em>.</p>
<p>Hosting the compiler so we haven&#39;t got JVM start-up time in this mess, and cutting this time down would make me a happier developer.</p>
<p><strong>My feedback to Jetbrains over this getting started bit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make it easier for me to just write a standalone file and execute it as a program please</li>
<li>Hide the legacy Java crap that I don&#39;t know anything about</li>
<li>Give me a Kotlin Command Line app option in IntelliJ which doesn&#39;t give me all the crap in the project</li>
<li>Keep the compiler in memory or do whatever else is needed so this feedback loop goes from a minimum of 15 seconds to a minimum of &lt; 0.1 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next up...</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ll go through some of the language features I liked, and some of the language features I didn&#39;t like and give some (hopefully) constructive feedback over them.</p>

        <p>But chances are I'm not available, as I'm busy shipping stuff.</p>
        <p>I am available for conference speaking, I like talking and will do so for just T&E (and perhaps a bottle of wine or two).</p>
        <p>I have done soft keynotes, and usually entertain/rile people in equal proportion, but prefer to talk tech as that's what I do</p>
