      <h1 id="post-title">Multi-tenancy in ASP.NET MVC - Why do we want it</h1>
      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2010-2-1</span></h6>
      <div id="post">
		<p><font face="Arial">I'll be gratuitously "borrowing" a lot&nbsp; of material from my DDD8 slides in this post, it seemed like the right thing to do given that this series is a write-up and then continuation of that talk.</font></p>
<font face="Arial">
<p><font face="Arial">When dealing with more than one customer in the desktop market, it is customary to have a single product which is extendable through the use of plug-ins and an API, and often you can leave it up to your consumer base to write those plug-ins and add to your product in a manner they see fit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In the web world it's a bit different, and you don't typically get that kind of behaviour (Facebook applications may or may not count, depending on how you look at it).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><br>
In a simple world, you'll have a single product which is used directly off the shelf by multiple customers:</font></p>
<p><img alt="Single product" src="http://fear.the.codeofrob.com/mt_why/single_product.png"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">When building web applications for a varied and paying customer base, It is likely that you have customers that are fickle and will want things done their way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It often does not make business sense to turn good business down, and the business is what pays the hungry developer and thus when you finally get a customer who wants things done differently,&nbsp; the business tells the developer to jump and the business's required response is the proverbial "how high?".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Consider the above diagram then, and imagine Customer A asking for something 'just a little bit different' and think about what your options could be.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We'll get the obvious dusted out of the way first:<br>
</font></p>
<p><img alt="if( featureIsEnabled....)" src="http://fear.the.codeofrob.com/mt_why/feature_code.png"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">When I switched to the above code as a slide in my multi-tenant talk, I was greeted with laughter, but we've all known products which have ended up with such delightful nuggets in them. <br>
It's blindingly obvious that it's not the right solution, and that as you progress down the route of making further modifications for either Customer A, B or C you'll end up with an un-maintainable mess of switches and flags. 'Nuff said.</font></p>
<font face="Arial">
<p><br>
</p>
<p>You could then decide that you're going to keep that customer as a new product in its own right - that would remove the need for all those on-off switches.</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial"><img alt="A bespoke copy" src="http://fear.the.codeofrob.com/mt_why/bespoke_copy.png"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial">This should very obviously be a big no-no as maintaining that then bespoke product and keeping it up to date with any changes then made to your core product is going to be nothing more than a giant headache. <br>
As you get more customers, the number of developers you'll need to hire will increase almost in direct proportion to the number of codebases you have to maintain!&nbsp; (Again, I've seen this done - so don't think I'm just pointing out the obvious for the sake of it)</font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Let's move onto the more-often used approach, of branching from a base product for your different needs, and utilising the power of a source control system to keep changes in sync between your code-bases.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img alt="Branching as an alternative" src="http://fear.the.codeofrob.com/mt_why/bespoke_branch.png"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Customer A can be kept up to date by merging changes from the core product, and Customer B/C can get additional features from Customer A's branch if and when they desire it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At first glances, it seems like this solution fits our needs - and indeed it can work well in a lot of given&nbsp; scenarios. The problem comes when you scale this solution up to more than this small example - as few of us are (un)lucky enough to&nbsp;be able to deal with only three customers and remain financially viable!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Here is a small example of 30 customers sharing 15 code-bases!<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img alt="A mess of branching dependencies" src="http://fear.the.codeofrob.com/mt_why/bespoke_mess.png"></font></p>
<font face="Arial">
<p><font face="Arial">Yowsers! <br>
How do you keep track of who has what features? <br>
How do you test all of those different branches of code? <br>
How do you deploy those branches of code?<br>
How do you make a new version of the product and serve it to a customer?<br>
How many developers do you need to manage that process?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It's never as simple as it looks, and you end up with not only the above problems, but you end up with the additional problems of what happens when a branch becomes radically different and you're unable to merge changes around.<br>
</font><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial">There is too much developer interaction here - and your skilled staff end up having to spend most of their time creating new branches/pushing changes around instead of spending their time doing what they're actually trained to do - writing code.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial"><br>
Adding a new customer shouldn't be about changing code, it should be about manipulating configuration, and modifying a customer shouldn't be about changing code, it should also be about manipulating configuration.&nbsp;<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In other words, problems should only be solved once - and configuration should be used to give or take features to and from customers.<br>
</font><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial"></font></font></p>
<font face="Arial"><font face="Arial"><strong>
<h3><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial"><strong>Enter multi-tenancy...</strong></font></font></h3>
</strong></font>
<p><font face="Arial">The core concept of a well written multi-tenant application is that you should have a single code base, and a number of configurations - where each configuration tells the runtime what functionality should be available and what the look/feel should be.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Before continuing, I'd like to define a few of the terms I'll be using throughout this series of blog entries.</font></p>
<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Module: A discrete set of functionality</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Theme: The look and feel</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Configuration:&nbsp; A selection of modules, and a single theme</font> </li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial">
<p><font face="Arial">This is a personal leaning, and I know that some people would set this up differently. Each to their own, we've got to draw lines somewhere!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><br>
</font><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial">Anyway - as far as I'm concerned, Multi-tenancy gives us some of the following benefits:</font> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Deployment becomes a simple case of installing your application onto a server, and setting up the configurations for that application.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">When a request comes in, context is determined by some means (auth credentials, the hostname, whatever), and the relevant configuration is selected from that context. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img alt="A single server serving multiple customers" src="http://fear.the.codeofrob.com/mt_why/multi_tenant_single.png"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial">This is a very simple way of working, and if you design your application correctly, it becomes obvious that your hosting/maintenance costs can be reduced.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can have multiple servers with the exact same codebase installed on them, and with all the configurations available to them (In other words, identical).&nbsp; Scaling up becomes a simple matter of adding more of those identical servers - and if you're really smart you can load balance across your VPSs and power them up/down as required. <br>
You no longer need to worry (too much) about the fact that you have all of those customers, and you can concentrate on the health of your system as a whole.<br>
</font></p>
<p><img alt="Load balanced multi-tenant system" src="http://fear.the.codeofrob.com/mt_why/multi_tenant_balanced.png"></p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;Some more benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">You add a feature once, and deploy it to your customers through the use of configuration</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">You can fix a bug, and deploy the fix once&nbsp;</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">&nbsp;Potentially easy management of your infrastructure (This actually&nbsp;comes through good design, and multi-tenancy just aids in that goal)</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Developers get to spend their time coding new features/fixing bugs</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial">New customers can have a site created in minutes and start to give feedback immediately</font> </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial">Everybody is a winner and we all get to go home and have pie and punch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In the next entry, things will hot up as I'll start to look at ASP.NET MVC and determine the components that we can use to aid us in creating a multi-tenant application.<br>

<br/> 				We're doing a basic multi-tenancy setup for our clients and I thought I'd share a trick. One of the wonderful benefits of MVC is the ability to use custom view engines. Ours searches for views in a client-specific set of folders and then if it doesn't find them, a default set of folders. This gives us the ability to customize a view per-client while still maintaining the same code base for everyone else.

<br/> 				Hi Rob, just like to say this is a very interesting tutorial. We've done something similar at my work, we tried a few of the "workflow" technologies and MEF to support this but in the end, we went with a solution quite similar to yours. It has one fundamental flaw though, versioning. At the moment there is no way to support different versions of the assembly within the same process (without appdomain) and get the view and controllers to use that particular appdomain. I wondered whether you had come across the problem and had solved it?Jamie

<div class="comment-body">
<br/> 				I'll disappoint you here and say that when I saw this as an issue, my solution was just to ensure that I never had different versions of assemblies.If I deploy code for one tenant, I deploy the code for the rest of the tenants too and do a full build, so I never get version mismatches.

<div class="comment-body">
<br/> 				Ahh well. Our hope is to be able to run C# 3.5 and 4.0 side by side which would obviously be different versions of assemblies (with the ability to do it with third party products as well).What we aren't wanting is to have an upgrade nightmare as a new "module" comes out, with other modules becoming incompatible. Module Isolation doesn't seem to be possible in MVC unfortunately.
