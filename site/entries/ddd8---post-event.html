      <div id="post">
		<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That was a wonderful day, and the sessions I ended up going to were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>@ICooper's session on MVC Architecture (preaching the choir but good to be re-assured) </li>
    <li>@robashton's session on Multi-tenant ASP.NET MVC (obviously) </li>
    <li>@holytshirt's session on Mono (Good to see this project is advancing well) </li>
    <li>@garyshort's session on JClosure (Lovely!) </li>
    <li>@blowdart's session on the crystal maze </li>
</ul>
<p>The last session was interrupted constantly by the MVPs and associated crowd&nbsp;because Barry is leaving the UK and heading off to MS to learn how to spell :)</p>
<p>There isn't much specifically to talk about really, it's been said by everybody. The event was well organised, the post-event meal was also surprisingly kept in control and the post-event drinks ... well I'd had no sleep the previous night so I left early. I believe fun was had by all however.</p>
<p>My talk? I think it went okay - I was a bit nervous presenting on a subject that doesn't get talked about openly all that much, and worried the audience might throw a few massive spanners in the works (although I am open to change, I don't want to be told outright I'm wrong in the middle of a talk!)</p>
<p>I spoke a bit fast, and had a minor emergency at the start when realising I needed an adapter for my laptop, but was saved by the team whose job it was to babysit me and massive thanks goes to them for saving my presentation :)</p>
<p>My slides can be found <a href="http://fear.the.codeofrob.com/ddd8slides.zip">here</a>, and demo code can be found <a href="http://fear.the.codeofrob.com/ddd8code.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>The nerd dinner multi-tenant example can be found on the MvcEx codeplex site (<a href="http://mvcex.codeplex.com">http://mvcex.codeplex.com</a>) - but I'll be hoping to improve it beyond its "suitable for demo" stage and do some blog entries on the rationale behind some of the decisions/concepts found within over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It's not perfect, it's not anywhere near done and as I keep telling people, it's just for reference purposes (at present), feel free to make suggestions, contributions and etc and we'll get there in the end. Multi-tenancy is the future you know?</p>
