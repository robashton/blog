		<p>I had a blog here once, it was mostly personal with a bit of code talk thrown in and the focus of the website was actually in showcasing all the projects I'd completed so people could see that I wasn't just a nerd who spent all his time on IRC and played games - I was a productive nerd who spent all his time on IRC and played games.<br>
<br>
I'd been spending the vast majority of my time since leaving university meandering around and writing code for various people whilst learning on my own personal projects.<br>
<br>
Roughly a year ago I went and got myself a "real job" in the "real world".<br>
<br>
The job I managed to wrangle myself into was that of a standard .NET Web developer, messing about in ASP.NET 2.0 on a hideous system that was a mess of badly written code written by people who were very new to .NET having worked on ASP projects previously.<br>
<br>
This project was ditched and because it was just a glorified CMS, it was moved across to an open source platform (Drupal) and because I've got no interest in maintaining open source CMS systems switched teams to help them write a bit of .NET for their (again) legacy ASP system.<br>
<br>
I now find myself a year later the technical lead/architect/whatever on a grand old web application written in .NET 3.5 using all the fancy modern technology that modern .NET web developers are supposed to be using. (ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, NHibernate/Fluent/Etc, xUnit etc)<br>
<br>
This grand old web application that we work on is for a host of really large companies (household names in a lot of cases), and we already have an old version of the application written in ASP which we're looking to move away from. There are over nine years of knowledge and experience captured in that old application and thus re-imagining it in .NET is a challenging prospect. <br>
<br>
Some of the requirements that have come up over time need us to come up with some rather innovative solutions when bringing them across to this brave new world and thus I've ended up with a whole suite of technical problems which we've had to overcome. <br>
<br>
This brings me to the point of this blog, I aim to document at least some of these problems here over time in order to foster either some discussion (Probably a bit hopeful), or at least to leave a vague trail in Google for other developers to follow when they encounter similar. <br>
<br>
At no point in this blog am I going to mention who I work for, or what the product is I work on, I am an opinionated person and some opinions are best kept as far away from the workplace as possible.</p>
