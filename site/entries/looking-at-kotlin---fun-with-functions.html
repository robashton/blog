<li>Looking at Kotlin - Fun with functions</li>
</ul>

<p>You can have some real fun with functions in Kotlin, let's do a really basic one first:</p>

<p><em>Extension methods</em></p>

<p>Extension methods were exciting a few years ago when they came out in C# because they offered the possibility of creating new and innovative APIs. There is little harm in them being in Kotlin then!</p>

<p>An extension method on the StringBuilder class which when invoked adds a new line to the builder:</p>

<pre><code>fun StringBuilder.newLine() {
    this.append("\n")
}
</code></pre>

<p>Simple enough.</p>

<p><strong>Function literals</strong></p>

<p>Any sane language has a way of declaring functions as variables. In JavaScript functions are objects just like anything else so this <em>just works</em>, in C# this ability was added as an afterthought so it is a bit ugly and Java well... it's Java.</p>

<p>A function that takes in nothing and returns nothing in Kotlin looks like:</p>

<pre><code>var function : () -&gt; Unit
</code></pre>

<p>If we wanted to invoke this, we could do so very easily</p>

<pre><code>function()
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, we'd have to define it first and that looks like this</p>

<pre><code>var function : () -&gt; Unit = {
  println("Hello world")
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can be implicit if we're combining declaration and definition so..</p>

<pre><code>var function = {
  println("Hello world")
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've got very few comments about this, it's pretty simples and self explanatory.</p>

<p>A few examples to help with the next bits</p>

<p><em>A function take takes in a string and returns nothing</em></p>

<pre><code>var print : (arg: String) -&gt; Unit = { (arg: String) -&gt;
  println(arg)
}
</code></pre>

<p>or implicitly</p>

<pre><code>var print = { (arg: String) -&gt;
  println(arg)
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>A function that takes in two numbers and returns their sum</em></p>

<pre><code>var sum = { (one: Int, two: Int) -&gt; one + two }
</code></pre>

<p>All of this is pretty nice, although it takes quite a bit of practice remembering what the various forms are for declaring these functions, what threw me (if I understand) is the difference between these function literals and declared functions.</p>

<p>With the function literals, it <em>seems</em> as though the returned value is the last statement in the function</p>

<pre><code>var doubleUp = { (val: Int) -&gt; 
  println("do a thing")
  val * 2 
}
</code></pre>

<p>where as in the declared functions it looks like this</p>

<pre><code>fun doubleUp(val: Int) : Int {
  println("do a thing")
  return val * 2
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure I understand this, two different ways of defining functions (plus all the various options we have around being implicit/explicit about the various aspects of the function) made it quite confusing to pick this up and I haven't even gone through some of the examples I saw on the Kotlin website.</p>

<p><strong>Passing functions around</strong></p>

<p>Given the following two methods, I want to invoke applyAndPrint with an array and the doubleUp function</p>

<pre><code>fun doubleUp(value: Int) : Int {
  return value * 2
}

fun applyAndPrint(values: Array&lt;Int&gt;, modifier: (value: Int) -&gt; Int) {
  for(i in values)
    println(modifier(i))
}
</code></pre>

<p>My first thought would be </p>

<pre><code>applyAndPrint(array(1,3,4,5), doubleUp)
</code></pre>

<p>But this doesn't actually work, which I find counter-intuitive - in fact I couldn't find a good way to do this other than</p>

<pre><code>applyAndPrint(array(1,3,4,5), {(x) -&gt; doubleUp(x)})
</code></pre>

<p>I'm definitely missing something here but the docs didn't really help me out.</p>

<p><strong>Setting the context of these passed functions</strong></p>

<p>Okay, this is where things get a bit cooler in theory - what if we had some sort of context (a builder) with some state in it and we want to invoke these functions transparently on top of these state.</p>

<p>Understand that? Well done, I don't - but here's an example</p>

<pre><code>class Builder (val multiplier: Int) {

    fun invokeStuff(action: (Builder.() -&gt; Unit)) {
        this.action()
    }

    fun multiply(value: Int) : Int {
        return value * multiplier
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The important bit here is the way we've declared the type of 'action'</p>

<pre><code>action: (Builder.() -&gt; Unit)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a function that returns nothing, takes in nothing but is invoked on an object of type "Builder".</p>

<p>This means when we use this builder like so</p>

<pre><code>var builder = Builder(10)
builder.invokeStuff({
  var result = multiply(1)
  println(result)
})
</code></pre>

<p>The context of 'this' has been set to the builder object and we can invoke functions declared within the builder.</p>

<p>Thing is, this context can be played with - consider that we can also create extension methods on types, let's say the Int type.</p>

<pre><code>class Builder (val multiplier: Int) {

    fun invokeStuff(action: (Builder.() -&gt; Unit)) {
        this.action()
    }

    fun multiply(value: Int) : Int {
        return value * multiplier
    }

    fun Int.doStuff(value: Int) : Int {
      return value * multiplier
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I can use this with</p>

<pre><code>var builder = Builder(10)
builder.invokeStuff({
  var result = 1.doStuff(50)
  println(result)
})
</code></pre>

<p><em>The scoping of extension functions</em></p>

<p>This is invalid code</p>

<pre><code>fun someFunction() {
    fun String.someOtherFunction() {

    }
}

fun someStuff() {
    "".someOtherFunction()
}
</code></pre>

<p>The extension method isn't visible because it was declared inside a different function.</p>

<p>This is the valid version:</p>

<pre><code>fun someFunction() {
    fun String.someOtherFunction() {

    }
    "".someOtherFunction()
}
</code></pre>

<p>The same goes for classes too, this is also invalid</p>

<pre><code>class someClass() {
    fun String.someOtherFunction() {

    }
}

fun someStuff() {
    "".someOtherFunction()
}
</code></pre>

<p>The scope is shared outwards when we set the context of those function calls, and this was clearly thought about.</p>

<p><em>Infix calls</em></p>

<p>And here is another feature, we have infix calls for functions with only one argument so..</p>

<pre><code>var builder = Builder(10)
builder.invokeStuff({
  var result = 1 doStuff 50
  println(result)
})
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My feedback</strong></p>

<p>There are so many things we can do with these functions and the way we do this seems to change with context (which is also something we control - haha, see what I did there?)</p>

<p>There is also power locked up in this state of affairs, I just wish it wasn't so confusing.</p>

<p>I don't see why there is a difference between function literals and declared functions (and if there isn't, I don't know why my examples work or why I'm so confused about it).</p>

<p>Functions are functions are functions, or at least they should be. I should be able to just do</p>

<pre><code>var doSomething = fun(x: Int) : Int {

}
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>map(doSomething)
</code></pre>

<p>Being able to pass in/set the context of calls is quite interesting for a specific use case (builders), and I kinda like it - although it feels a bit like something we could abuse horribly (and in fact, in the workshop we did - this is valid Kotlin code)</p>

<pre><code>json {
    "name" .. "Rob Ashton"
    "age" .. 5
    "address" .. {
        "number" .. 444
        "line one" .. "never you mind"
    }
    "family".array(
        {
            "name" .. "Gareth Ashton"
            "relation" .. "brother"
        },
        {
            "name" .. "Suzanne Ashton"
            "relation" .. "sister"
        })
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I don't know is all the angles that are trying to be covered, so it's hard to tell why we've ended up in a situation where there is so much to learn about functions.</p>

<p>If you need a page on "<a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/Kotlin/This+expressions#Thisexpressions-Qualified">this ambiguiguity</a>", then probably you've gone too far.</p>

<p>Like the other language features so far, it feels a bit like there were some cool features thought of, and then things got a little bit of hand as the edge cases were discovered.</p>

<ul>
<li>I like infix notation</li>
<li>I like being able to pass functions around</li>
<li>I like being able to make function literals</li>
<li>I like extension methods</li>
<li>I like the scoping of extension methods</li>
<li>I like having type safety in the above</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd just make an effort to prune it back and make things a bit more cohesive. I'd definitely take a look at context and try to avoid the need for pages explaining how to manage it. </p></div>
