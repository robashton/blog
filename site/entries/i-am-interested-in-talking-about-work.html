      <h1 id="post-title">I am interested in talking about work</h1>
      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2013-4-1</span></h6>
      <div id="post"><p>By the time July rolls around, I will have spent half a year travelling around <a href="/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html">working for free</a>, learning new technologies, picking up new skills and in general becoming a <a href="/entries/a-note-on-working-hours-and-working-at-home.html">happier person</a>.</p>

<p>I can't keep doing this forever, aside from the slow drip of money out of my bank accounts I already miss having a permanent base to go back to.</p>

<p>So, from July I'll need to start earning a regular or semi-regular income once more, and it is therefore time to publicise let the world know I'm ready for it again.</p>

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>

<p>I have spent the past decade delivering software primarily in the Microsoft space with a focus on C# and JS. I mostly end up in charge of the software projects I'm involve with and have a focus on keeping the team's options open and able to react to change.</p>

<p>I am a regular on the conference circuit and tend to talk about testing, javascripts and pragmatic development in .NET.</p>

<p>I write code, I write a <em>lot</em> of code, I have the ability to learn things <em>quickly</em> and start delivering early on after starting a new role and I am an enthusiastic sharer of ideas and opinions.</p>

<p><strong>What I'm offering</strong></p>

<p>I am offering my nimble fingers and active mind to anyone in the world, I can...</p>

<ul>
<li>Help build features, and teach at the same time</li>
<li>Run workshops on JS (back-end or front-end), ASP.NET MVC and RavenDB</li>
<li>Improve your testing strategies</li>
<li>Help remove obstacles from your development process!</li>
<li>Help you move forward from your legacy issues (Silverlight to ...?)</li>
<li>Advise on your long-term architectural problems/goals</li>
</ul>

<p>I am good at shipping code, I am knowledgable in many areas of .NET development and have spent a lot of time using and developing against alternative databases for the past few years.</p>

<p><strong>What I looking for</strong></p>

<p>I am flexible, I ask for you to be the same. I am always happy to travel on-site providing my expenses are covered, but I think I am going to start renting a house again and will probably want to be spending some time there in between trips.</p>

<p>I am most likely looking for short-term consultancy work (4-5 days) and short-term development work (2-8 weeks). </p>

<p>I am looking for work in any country; as mentioned above I'm happy to travel.</p>

<p>My rates are flexible and tend to vary depending on country, convenience and company. I am looking to sustain a lifestyle and can afford this flexibility.</p>

<p><strong>So</strong></p>

<p>Do get in touch at <a href="mailto:robashton@codeofrob.com">robashton@codeofrob.com</a> and ask me for availability from July onwards, I am already starting to fill my calendar with paid work from that date onwards so will likely need advance notice for anything more than a week or so.</p></div>
