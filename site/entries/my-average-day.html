      <h6>Published on <span class="date">2013-11-2</span></h6>
      <div id="post"><p>I&#39;m asked quite often what I do on my downtime - which I have plenty of - well currently I&#39;m</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing a <a href="http://github.com/robashton/cravendb">document database in Clojure</a></li>
<li>Doing a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/stats1">statistics course</a></li>
<li><a href="/hire.html">Trying to find new clients</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I tend to be pretty focused and don&#39;t do more than one thing at a time, here is a run-down from my day today.</p>
<p><strong>9AM</strong></p>
<p>I don&#39;t tend to set an alarm, but I&#39;m usually out of the house by 9AM - I wake up fairly quickly in the morning and my brain tends to be ready for action before the rest of my body is.</p>
<p>I get a train from my current lodgings into Kings Cross and I get </p>
<ul>
<li>An espresso from <a href="http://twitter.com/beanstalklondon">Beanstalk</a></li>
<li>A really nice tea from <a href="https://twitter.com/goodpropertea">Good Proper Tea</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>I usually at this point walk towards where I&#39;m going to be working for the rest of the day, wherever that is - which is usually somewhere East London regardless of whether I have a client or not.</p>
<p>Today I walked down into Farringdon whilst supping my hot tea, this gives my body a chance to catch up with my brain to find out what each other are doing.</p>
<p><strong>10AM</strong></p>
<p>I always try to do a chore or two in the morning before I begin work, today I needed to set up a suit for hire as I&#39;ve a wedding to attend to on Saturday, yesterday it was a bank appointment. These things need fitting in or I&#39;ll just drop them because I get too obsessed with the code I&#39;m writing at this particular moment in time.</p>
<p><strong>10:30AM</strong></p>
<p>Work + Breakfast! I usually try to go into <a href="http://www.prufrockcoffee.com/">Prufrock</a> for this, as they have the best coffee combined with good wifi, but sadly they were packed today so I went across the road to <a href="http://www.departmentofcoffee.co.uk/">Department of Coffee and Social Affairs</a>. I try not to scoff too much for breakfast and this is when I crank out my first code. Today I&#39;m working on my document database as I have a week of downtime.</p>
<p>The rule generally is, code until the macbook has no more battery which is ~3 hours, and that is what I did today - running out of battery around 13:00PM, which conveniently is lunchtime as well.</p>
<p>The battery running out and the forced moving on ensures I have a break, I made quite a few commits to my database projecte this morning and I&#39;m already getting pretty bleary eyed!</p>
<p><strong>13:00PM</strong></p>
