<p>I get this question asked of me with an increasing frequency as my thoughts and feelings on Angular and most frameworks get spread around the internet (and with Angular an increasing number of people seem to finally agree so that further amplifies the reach).</p>
<p>The question always seems to boil down to a premise and the actual question being asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to learn JS because JS is what we use to build things these days</li>
<li>What do I learn if I want to get employed writing JS</li>
</ul>
<p>This is usually thrown in with something like &quot;I heard AngularJS would make it easier for me so what gives?&quot;</p>
<p>Sadly these things are not mutually exclusive and also depressingly there isn&#39;t ever a question about whether JS is really appropriate in the first place (hint: It&#39;s probably not, we&#39;re doing it all wrong but that&#39;s a whole book full of essays in itself)</p>
<p>If we take the premise therefore that this is indeed the state of things then let&#39;s roll forward with some sort of answer - not <em>the</em> answer of course, because like any writer will tell you - sometimes it&#39;s easier to ramble on about history before getting to the main course.</p>
<h1 id="the-problem-with-jquery">The problem with jQuery</h1>
<p>I&#39;ve already mentioned how back in the day I quite liked all these little (mostly) self-contained modules written aagainst jQuery and how this made it fairly easy to compose an application. I did rather gloss over some of the pain caused by the mass influx of developers once jQuery &quot;finally made it easy&quot; to write JS.</p>
<p>The outcome was fairly predictable really.</p>

<p>This is actually from a <a href="http://www.doxdesk.com/updates/2009.html#u20091116-zalgo">blog post</a> by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/18936/bobince">bobince</a> but is indicative of actual questions that happened on stackoverflow during the peak of jQuery.</p>
<p>What was the problem? The problem was that jQuery made it super easy to bundle together a bunch of self-contained components on a page, glue them together with some copy and pasted JS from the internet and call it a day. So many web front-ends were smattered with the same jQuery plug-ins that they ended up being as slow and clunky as some of the back-ends they were supporting.</p>
<p>The issue here was that people were trying to be productive before having learned the ropes and the result was jQuery all the way down. jQuery made it very easy to give us the illusion of productivity at the cost of basic effectiveness over time. Having jQuery on your CV however meant getting jobs and there was no shortage of people able to us the almighty dollar symbol in order to put some dollars in their pockets.</p>
<h1 id="is-that-really-a-problem-">Is that really a problem?</h1>
<p>People were working and being fed, software was being built and presumably most of it making money - so what&#39;s the big deal?</p>
