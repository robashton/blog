- Starting at Mastadon
- Forking the repo
- Example of dense Clojure-riffic stuff
- Where on earth is the data
- Download it myself (I wonder if this could be automated)
- Special form for ignoring the next form? #_
- So this is something we are running manually as we build stuff up?
- Have I got the right data sets?  (I downloaded may 2013 practise presribing data) (Ah, PDPI is in the filename, so maybe yes)
- Could really do with a list of the data sets and where they're expected if that doesn't exist
- Time taken to process 1gb of data? How would we make it faster?
