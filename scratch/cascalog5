So part 5 of this Impatient Cascalog Tutorial for an Impatient Rob...

I opened the source and saw a good 65 lines of code - which is a lot more than I've been dealing with so far.

I had a go at reading through without the tutorial and it seems to make sense, bar some more weird operators/macros/whatevers like *(??-* how the hell do you google even I just don't what.

So anyway, to the tutorial to see why suddenly there is 300% more code since the last one...

# Part 5

    Today's lesson builds on that same Word Count app and now implements TF-IDF in Cascalog.

Ah okay, I'd better go and read that Wikipedia page on [TF-IDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) so I have any chance of following what is going on here.

*Oh okay then*, so basically it's an algorithm by which if we work out that a word isn't used very often and you're searching for it then it's probably the important word in your query - makes sense *ONWARDS*
