A note on prevalence

In the diabetes data, we have prevalance per ccg data - we can't do that for ADHD as there is no easily available data
So we'll have to make assumptions
We only have the data for 17+ people, we can ask for more from Twitter
We actually don't want the costings for ADHD perhaps, the numbers themselves might be more useful
