- Finding more drugs
- Signing into the british national formulary
- pre-filtering the data
- We can read off an output very handily

- Total amount spent per month
- Total amount spent per gp
- Etc

A note on prevalence

In the diabetes data, we have prevalance per ccg data - we can't do that for ADHD as there is no easily available data
So we'll have to make assumptions
We only have the data for 17+ people, we can ask for more from Twitter
We actually don't want the costings for ADHD perhaps, the numbers themselves might be more useful

- Building the map using spruce-leaf, repl, manually adding headers

- Standard deviation is a better way of showing off the chart
- We can probably show a couple of data points here 
- How much are we spending per head on ADHD per CCG?
- How much are we spending
- Variance - Trying to write a custom predicate macro
- Giving up and realising there was one already
- Looking at the source of that custom predicate macro using vim
- Check your goddamned data
