<blockquote><p>I loved your 'Hire Me' link on the top of the page. Hire you? After reading this piece of juvenile, self-centered, ignorant, self-important bullshit? I don't think so. When you grow up you might understand that real software is built by people of many different tribes, working together. Not some neat little cabal that you seem so scared to venture out from. Did diddums take away all your nice toys? Please. Join the real world.</p> <small><a href="http://codeofrob.com/entries/you-have-ruined-javascript.html#comment-1353679811">Paul Bennet</a> 2014</small></blockquote>
