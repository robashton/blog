                <p>I learn in the open on <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> where others can benefit from my learning and use the code that I write as they see fit, I also take part in 48hour game-development competitions to practice fast delivery and the art of focus.</p> 
                <p>I don't have a particular philosophy about open source development, but I do believe that code is rarely the main intellectual property of a business and that there are postive benefits from engaging with the open source community</p>
                <p>I have released 3D games written using JS and WebGL, contributed heavily to RavenDB and written my own database in Clojure as well as many other things that are also available on Github</p>

                <p>I love writing technical content as a way of sharing my ideas on software and career development. I have a large readership on a number of topics including testing, client-side JS development, RavenDB and C# best practises.</p>
                <p>I try to write about software as I develop it, aiming to both document my thought processes for myself and to try and share this with other people for their benefit</p>
                <p>I occasionally write guest posts for other publications, but primarily keep the writing limited to my blog because I need time to actually build software.</p>
