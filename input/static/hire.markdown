Drop me an e-mail at [robashton@codeofrob.com](mailto:robashton@codeofrob.com) to set up a conversation via phone/skype/in-person with no obligation.

## Me

- I will work in pretty much any language or technology, what matters to me is the team and the project.
- I have a strong preference for project-based work
- I love writing JS, I prefer an npm/library/browserify based approach but will work in Angular etc too
- I will happily write C# 
- I am getting better at writing Clojure
- I like long term relationships with repeat clients
- I travel a lot, I like to work remote from coffee shops
- I enjoy spending time on-site too, so desk space is appreciated
- I am in theory London based, always very happy to fly out on location for a few weeks
- I charge a flat fee of Â£500 a day, but this is negotiable for the right work
- My ideal contract length is between 2-6 weeks, this gets the best for both of us
