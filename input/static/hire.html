                <p>So I've removed the guidelines. They were relevant last year when I was taking a break between real engagements but now I'm getting back into the swing of long-term development and <i>getting stuff done</i>.</p>
                <p>If you need a consult, or a bit of training then do contact me as I may be able to help, but I'm not promising anything - I've a full-time remote job and I'm presently happy.</p>
