<p><a href="/entries/im-leaving-.net.html">It wasn&#39;t working out as well as I hoped.</a></p>
<p>Not quite as dramatic as <a href="http://tekpub.com/products/change-it-up">my last exit</a>, but quitting while I&#39;m ahead in terms of personal relationships and drama. I&#39;m not motivated enough for it to work out.</p>
<p><em>So with that...</em></p>
<p>My plans? I&#39;m open to suggestions, if anybody wants me for a month or so and can pay me a reasonable amount of cash for the work then hit me up at <a href="mailto:robashton@codeofrob.com">robashton@codeofrob.com</a>. That&#39;s .NET, Ruby or JS - don&#39;t really care. I&#39;d prefer to be tappity tappity at a keyboard, but will consider doing some JS or Raven training if you ask nicely.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently in London, giving some consideration to hanging around here for various reasons but also happy to leave the city once more as well. That&#39;s a discussion we can have. </p>
<p>My needs/desires are still pretty <a href="/entries/i-am-interested-in-talking-about-work.html">much as they were before</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I prefer not having to work in the office</li>
<li>I prefer working in coffee shops</li>
<li>Money isn&#39;t so important, but I need to be able to afford coffee and beer.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#39;t think taking on anything as a &quot;long term thing&quot; is going to be right for me right now so please don&#39;t come at me with such offers. I&#39;d prefer a short term relationship with anybody I&#39;m going to be working with, and if we hit it off perhaps we can re-negotiate that after the fact.</p>
<p><em>Let&#39;s try this again</em></p>
<p>I&#39;m going to keep trying until I <a href="/entries/working-for-free-and-what-it-taught-me.html">get it right</a>, this probably won&#39;t be the last time this year :)</p>
