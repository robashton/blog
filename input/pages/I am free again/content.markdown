[It wasn't working out as well as I hoped.](/entries/im-leaving-.net.html)

Not quite as dramatic as [my last exit](http://tekpub.com/products/change-it-up), but quitting while I'm ahead in terms of personal relationships and drama. I'm not motivated enough for it to work out.

*So with that...*

My plans? I'm open to suggestions, if anybody wants me for a month or so and can pay me a reasonable amount of cash for the work then hit me up at [robashton@codeofrob.com](mailto:robashton@codeofrob.com). That's .NET, Ruby or JS - don't really care. I'd prefer to be tappity tappity at a keyboard, but will consider doing some JS or Raven training if you ask nicely.

I'm currently in London, giving some consideration to hanging around here for various reasons but also happy to leave the city once more as well. That's a discussion we can have. 

My needs/desires are still pretty [much as they were before](/entries/i-am-interested-in-talking-about-work.html):

- I prefer not having to work in the office
- I prefer working in coffee shops
- Money isn't so important, but I need to be able to afford coffee and beer.

I don't think taking on anything as a "long term thing" is going to be right for me right now so please don't come at me with such offers. I'd prefer a short term relationship with anybody I'm going to be working with, and if we hit it off perhaps we can re-negotiate that after the fact.

*Let's try this again*

I'm going to keep trying until I [get it right](/entries/working-for-free-and-what-it-taught-me.html), this probably won't be the last time this year :)
