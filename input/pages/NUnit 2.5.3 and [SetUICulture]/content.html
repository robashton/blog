<p>I've posted to the mailing list and started off the process of working out whether it is a bug or not, but for now - I need to have my tests running&nbsp; in the right culture, without any side effects on the other tests once a test has been complete.</p>
<p>Here is my hack to do that:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp;" title="code">   public class CultureContext : IDisposable
    {
        private CultureInfo mOldCulture;

        public CultureContext(String cultureName)
        {
            mOldCulture = System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture;
            System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo(cultureName);
        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
            System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = mOldCulture;
        }
    }</pre>
<p>The usage is as follows, within a test do:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp;" title="code">using (new CultureContext("fr-FR"))
{
	// Test code here
}</pre>
<p>This will ensure that your test runs with the ui culture of "fr-FR", before resetting it to whatever it was before the test began. Not pretty, but it'll do until I work out if it's user error or a bug preventing NUnit from doing what I want it to do!</p>
