True you can create indexes to make read operations light, but then you need to make sure that your indexes fit in memory and etc etc.</p>  <p>I’ll stop there unless anyone complains notably, because trying to describe the differences between Couch and Mongo is a big enough task in itself, in fact you can read more about this <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Comparing+Mongo+DB+and+Couch+DB">here</a>, and note for yourself that they really are entirely different animals.</p>  <p>CouchDB and RavenDB on the other hand are both geared very much towards read-heavy applications, providing up front map/reduce indexes (or materialised views) on data, scaling horizontally via replication (although Raven supports this <strong>and</strong> sharding), and they both use REST as their method of access to the data store.</p>  <p>There are other document databases out there, and they all do things differently, but these are the two getting the most traction from the developer eco-system that I am familiar with. Thus, I shall be comparing RavenDB against CouchDB in this series of blog entries.</p>  <p><strong>So, they’re the same right?</strong></p>  <p>No, not really – and to be honest I thought that aside from the major differences that RavenDB contains such as transactions, sharding, linq-based-indexes, full text search, extensibility that this was the case!</p>  <p>Okay, that’s a fairly big list of differences already, but the features that are additions over CouchDB are primarily candy for developer use</p>  <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Until last week, I hadn’t properly touched CouchDB, and it was only at a workshop ran by <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DevTank/">DevTank</a> in London that I realised quite how different the two databases were in functionality, use and design. However – while I’m about to launch into a series of posts about this topic, I might well be wrong about a few things (due to lack of exposure), and I’ll be happy to update my blog posts and admit that I am wrong when it is pointed out to me :).</em></p>  <p><strong>Where are we going with this?</strong></p>  <p>Obviously I have next to me a <em>massive</em> list of differences between CouchDB and RavenDB, and it really is a big list. I’ll be splitting it out over the coming days into a series of blog entries exploring these differences in detail and giving my opinions on them.</p>
