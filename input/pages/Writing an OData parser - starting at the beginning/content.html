<p>I'm going off what is specified in both the OData spec and the OData URI conventions document.</p>

<p>This is a bit annoying, because it seems like URI conventions are just that, conventions - and people are free to do what they want (I haven't looked at the metadata spec yet so I'm not sure how discoverable this customisability is, I guess I'll get there during my time on this task)</p>

<p>What I think I can start with, is parsing the following basics</p>

<ul>
<li>The service root itself (http://example.com/service/odata.svc for example)</li>
<li>An entity at this root ( /model )</li>
<li>An entity with a key ( /model(1) )</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to develop this</strong></p>

<p>This is yet another task I'll probably write tests for as I go so I can document how far I've gotten and have a safety net as I no doubt make lots of mistakes.</p>

<p>I'll copy and paste code from the old OData parser as I need it and as I write the tests to support it, in this even the legacy code will end up with coverage.</p>
