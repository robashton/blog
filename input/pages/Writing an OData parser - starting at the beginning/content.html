<p>I'm going off what is specified in both the OData spec and the OData URI conventions document.</p>

<p>This is a bit annoying, because it seems like URI conventions are just that, conventions - and people are free to do what they want (I haven't looked at the metadata spec yet so I'm not sure how discoverable this customisability is, I guess I'll get there during my time on this task)</p>

<p>What I think I can start with, is parsing the following basics</p>

<ul>
<li>The service root itself (http://example.com/service/odata.svc for example)</li>
<li>An entity at this root ( /model )</li>
<li>An entity with a key ( /model(1) )</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How I'll develop this</strong></p>

<p>This is yet another task I'll probably write tests for as I go so I can document how far I've gotten and have a safety net as I no doubt make lots of mistakes.</p>

<p>I'll copy and paste code from the old OData parser as I need it and as I write the tests to support it, in this even the legacy code will end up with coverage.</p>

<p>In this way, I hope to be able to hand this over to Rulemotion in its semi-complete state but with a nice document (the tests) explaining what is covered so far.</p>

<p><strong>My first few tests</strong></p>

<p>I'll not bother covering the order in which I do this, as it's pretty similar to how I did the JSON parser, except I can make a few more assumptions because I know a but more about how OMeta works.</p>

<pre><code>function test(input, entry, expectation) {
  describe("Parsing " + input, function() {
    var parser = ODataParser.createInstance()
    var result = parser.matchAll(input, entry)
    expectation(result)
  });
}

test("/", "OData", function(result) {
  it("Service root should have no model", function() {
     assert.equal(result.resource, null)
  })
})

test("/model", "OData", function(result) {
  it("should have the resource specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.resource, 'model')
  })
})

test("/model(1)", "OData", function(result) {
  it("should have the resource specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.resource, 'model')
  })
  it("should have the key specified for the source", function() {
     assert.equal(result.key, '1')
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>After the first couple of tests, setting up the parser etc was a ball-ache so I fixed it.</p>

<p>I'm missing out the bit where I specify what the service root is, I'll come back to it later as I'm more interested in parsing the path itself.</p>

<p>This is what I wrote to support the above tests:</p>

<pre><code>ometa ODataParser 
  Number = &lt;digit+&gt;:d -&gt; parseInt(d, 10),

  OData = (
      ResourceUri()
    | '/'
  ) 
  ,

  ResourceUri = 
      '/'
        ResourceName:resource
        (
          ("(" Number:key ")")?
        ) -&gt; { resource: resource, key: key }
      ,

  ResourcePart =
    &lt;    (   letter
      |    '_'
      )+
    &gt;:resourcePart
    -&gt; resourcePart.replace(new RegExp('_', 'g'), ' '),

  ResourceName =
    &lt;    ResourcePart
      (    '-'
        ResourcePart
      )*
    &gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Things of note</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm currently returning the model from ResourceUri as { resource: resource, key: key }, I'll end up making something else for this I think</li>
<li>The "key" is optional, if it's not there then it will simply be undefined, this is what that question mark is for after those braces</li>
<li>The ResourcePart and ResourceName are copied from the old code and simply convert underscores into spaces, I haven't bothered writing tests for this as I've not checked what ODatas rules are for entity names yet (bite me)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all very rudimentary, now - looking at the URI conventions, they seem to support arbitrary paths into object relationships like so:</p>

<pre><code>/model(1)/children(1)/otherchildren(1)/field
</code></pre>

<p>This suggests I probably want to recurse in order to build up this sequence</p>

<pre><code>test("/model(1)/child", "OData", function(result) {
  it("should have the resource specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.resource, 'model')
  })
  it("should have the resource specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.resource, 'model')
  })
  it("should have the key specified for the resource", function() {
     assert.equal(result.key, '1')
  })
  it("should have the child specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.resource.next, 'child')
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if this is an appropriate representation, but it'll do for now until I find out how we're going to be consuming this model.</p>

<p>Having just arrived at the hotel and written this all on the boat, I'll defer having a look at how to do this until tomorrow, I've already passed the balmers peak.</p>
