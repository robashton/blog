<p>I went for lunch with the a friend the other day and he kindly gave me an idea for a blog post about JavaScript frameworks...</p>

<p><blockquote>
    I keep an eye on StackOverflow/Github/etc and mentally tot up the popularity of all these JS frameworks...
  </blockquote></p>

<p><em>ooooh</em>, that's a good one that. If we're <em>really</em> going to say "We use FrameworkX" (and I advocate that you <em>never</em> do this, it's a silly thing to do), then let's make our decision on cold hard numbers.</p>

<p>Except let's not just look at popularity, let's think about the support and education and how we could find some metrics to determine thee things.</p>

<p>Here are a few assumptions I'm making for this post to work</p>

<ul>
<li>StackOverflow is popular enough for the data to be representative (it's the de-facto place to ask programming questions)</li>
<li>The number of questions/un-answered questions is indicative of support</li>
<li>Github is popular enough for the data to be representative</li>
<li>The number of projects, and the number of stars on a project is indicative of popularity/use</li>
</ul>

<h1>Number of questions and unanswered questions on StackOverflow</h1>

<p>The Stackoverflow guys are amazing, and <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/queries">provide querying capabilities right there on their site</a>, which means I can get some numbers right off the bat for the various frameworks</p>

<p>I ended up with the following parameterised query to get my data</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @TagName varchar(128) = '%##TagName##%'

SELECT COUNT(*) from Posts P
WHERE P.Id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT(PostId) from PostTags 
  WHERE PostTags.TagId In (
    SELECT Id From Tags Where TagName LIKE @TagName
  )
)

SELECT COUNT(*) from Posts P
WHERE P.Id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT(PostId) from PostTags 
  WHERE PostTags.TagId In (
    SELECT Id From Tags Where TagName LIKE @TagName
  )
) AND P.AcceptedAnswerId IS NOT NULL

SELECT SUM(P.AnswerCount) from Posts P
WHERE P.Id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT(PostId) from PostTags 
  WHERE PostTags.TagId In (
    SELECT Id From Tags Where TagName LIKE @TagName
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this meant I got all the questions with all the tags in the eco-system around that framework, and the data I want is</p>

<ul>
<li>How many questions are there?</li>
<li>How many of those questions have accepted answers?</li>
<li><p>How mant answers do we get on average per question?</p>

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Framework</td><td>Questions</td><td>Answered</td><td>%</td><td>Average answers per question</td>
  </tr>
</thead>
  <tr><td>backbone</td><td>8863</td><td>5741</td><td>64.7%</td><td>1.42</td></tr>
  <tr><td>angular</td><td>5498</td><td>3401</td><td>61.8%</td><td>1.32</td></tr>
  <tr><td>knockout</td><td>5624</td><td>3917</td><td>69.6%/5624</td><td>1.31</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ember</td><td>10086</td><td>6426</td><td>63.71%</td><td>1.63</td></tr>
</table></li>
</ul>

<p>This in itself is quite interesting, as it doesn't seem like there is a lot of difference between them - although there are a lot more questions about Ember than some of the other frameworks the accept rate is about the same.</p>

<p>To get some sense of this data, let's look at Github to shed further light on this</p>

<h1>Framework popularity</h1>

<p>For this, we can head to <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> as that's where all sensible OSS projects are hosted these days - let's have a quick look at some basic stats about these projects. They're all actively using Github to track issues from the look of things so we can gleam a little bit about them from this data.</p>

<p><table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Framework</td>  <td>Stars</td> <td>Forks</td>  <td>Issues open</td>  <td>Issues closed</td>  <td>Pull requests open</td>   <td>Pull requests closed</td>
      </tr>
    </thead>
      <tr><td>backbone</td> <td>14148</td> <td>2713</td>  <td>23</td>             <td>2508</td>          <td>5</td>                    <td>1100</td>          </tr>
      <tr><td>angular</td>  <td>9692</td>  <td>1942</td>  <td>655</td>            <td>2037</td>          <td>52</td>                   <td>1150</td>          </tr>
      <tr><td>knockout</td> <td>3708</td>  <td>559</td>   <td>235</td>            <td>738</td>           <td>59</td>                   <td>275</td>           </tr> 
      <tr><td>ember</td>    <td>6997</td>  <td>1324</td>  <td>196</td>            <td>2487</td>          <td>61</td>                   <td>1250</td>          </tr>
  </table></p>

<p>I'm surprised Ember being the second least "popular" framework on Github given the high number of questions on Stackoverflow, but I can keep digging before jumping to any conclusions.</p>

<h1>Safety in numbers</h1>

<p>This data (when combined with the previous queries) begins to get a little bit more useful if we want to jump to some conclusions already; I'd like to dig deeper into the history of these projects and see who exactly has contributed to them. I don't want to be choosing a framework just because it has a large number of users, I care about who is doing the development too!</p>

<p>To do this, we have the Github API to look at </p>

<pre><code>https://api.github.com/repos/{user}/{repo}/contributors
</code></pre>

<p>What do the contribution distributions look like for these projects?</p>

<h3>Top 10 contributors and their commit counts</h3>

<p><div id="contribution-graph"></p>

<p></div></p>

<p>There's not an awful lot on this, although Backbone seems to be a bit of a one-man show, angular and ember get love from a few people and Knockout looks like most .NET projects do (sorry Steve).</p>

<h1>A brief history of source</h1>

<p>Now I'm looking at committers, we can probably dig a bit deeper and see how this looks over time to get some further insight into the stability of the projects and how this contributor activity looks over time.</p>

<p>I was going to just paste the charts from Github here, but they weren't really representative of activity and the Angular one just plain-old-wasn't-working at the time</p>

<p>I've found a git library for nodejs and will use it to generate a graph of activity over time. What you'd expect to see is that older more stable projects should see a tendency towards less activity and hopefully more contributors as the community fixes issues)</p>

<p><div id="contribution-over-time"></p>

<p></div></p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>Now I can probably draw a few rudimentary conclusions at this point:</p>

<ul>
<li>Despite having only third of the followers on Github, Ember has far more questions being asked on Github</li>
<li>Ember also has a similar amount of activity on Github itself to Backbone (although this could be indicative of the way they use Github)</li>
<li>Knockout really doesn't have a lot of love (presumably that's mostly the .NET crowd), backed up by the high activity and answer-rate on Stackoverflow</li>
<li>Backbone is a "mature" project, if its number of "open" issues is anything to go by</li>
<li>Angular is undergoing <em>heavy activity</em> and churn still, with over 600 issues still open on Github</li>
<li>Judging by its size, the Knockout contributors aren't keeping up well with the </li>
</ul>

<p>If I was waving my arms in the air and saying "<em>we must choose and use a framework</em> based on this data so far, I'd be jumping on the Backbone or angular ships because</p>

<ul>
<li>They both have a large community as evidenced by activity on Github</li>
<li>High acceptance rate on Stackoverflow</li>
<li>Low number of questions for its size</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's that.</p>
