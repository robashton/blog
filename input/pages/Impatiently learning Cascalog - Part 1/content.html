<p>My client for the next 8-9 days is going to be <a href="https://www.mastodonc.com/">Mastodon C</a>, who have kindly agreed to let me work for them in order to get some real-world Clojure-ish experience and pick up whatever other skills are there to be picked up while I&#39;m at it in the field of data anlytics.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/otfrom">@otfrom</a> has pointed me in the direction of &quot;<a href="https://github.com/Cascading/Impatient-Cascalog">Cascalog for the Impatient</a>&quot; and a the &quot;<a href="http://openhealthdata.cdehub.org/">CDEC Open Health Data Platform</a> (mapping diabetes across the UK)&quot; in preparation for my week working with them and before I turn up I&#39;m going to go through the tutorial and see what I understand and what I don&#39;t understand and write about my thought processes as I do it.</p>
<p>Anybody else following the Cascalog for the Impatient tutorial for the first time might find my notes useful, but at any rate <em>I&#39;ll</em> be able to go back and look at them myself and that&#39;s worthwhile too.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>
<p>I git cloned the repo, and typed </p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">lein uberjar</span></code></pre><p>This built me a jar and I was able to run Hadoop with the following command:</p>
<pre><code> hadoop jar target<span class="hljs-regexp">/impatient.jar data/</span>rain.txt output/rain</code></pre><p>Which did something with the input &quot;rain.txt&quot; and dumped it in the specified output folder.</p>
<p>This satisfied for me that my environment is sane and I could therefore carry on with the tutorial.</p>
<p>First up, we are shown this code with some rough explanation of how it works</p>
<pre><code class="language-clojure">(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">-main</span> [in out &amp; args]
  (<span class="hljs-name">?&lt;-</span> (<span class="hljs-name">hfs-delimited</span> out)
    [?doc ?line]
    ((<span class="hljs-name">hfs-delimited</span> in <span class="hljs-symbol">:skip-header?</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>) ?doc ?line)))</code></pre>
<p>I find the tutorial at this point to make some assumptions about my knowledge of what is going on here, it states that</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a main method that takes in an &#39;input&#39; and &#39;output&#39; path</li>
<li>We can create a <em>generator</em> over &#39;in&#39; using (hfs-delimited)</li>
<li>We can create a <em>sink</em> over &#39;out&#39; using (hfs-delimited)</li>
<li>We then name the vars from the generator with the ?doc ?line bits</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I have a few questions outstanding from this, chiefly</p>
<ul>
<li>Wtf is a generator</li>
<li>Wtf is a sink</li>
<li>Wtf is up with that <em>(?&lt;-</em> thingy</li>
<li>How are we naming those vars, how come its different for the sink and the generator?</li>
</ul>
<p>Dumb questions I&#39;m sure - but I&#39;m happy enough to admit my ignorance and press on.</p>
<p>I read the page linked in the impatient docs: <a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog/wiki/How-cascalog-executes-a-query">How cascalog executes a query</a></p>
<p>And I establish that (at least as a working hypothesis)</p>
<ul>
<li>A generator is just a predicate that gives you data?</li>
<li>A sink is somewhere the output can be put (a query can just have an output specified and that&#39;s it)</li>
<li>The (?&lt;- thingy is like the (&lt;- thingy, and what they are is simply<ul>
<li>The one without a question mark is a definition of a query</li>
<li>the one with a question mark is both the definition and an execution of a query</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the naming of the vars - ... is just &quot;because&quot;, I&#39;ll take that at face value and move on</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-result-of-running-this-thing">The result of running this thing</h1>
<p>I see that in the output folder there is a file called part-0000 which has the same content as the input file. So it looks like our generator and our sink are effectively the same thing and we&#39;re just streaming the data from one place to another without changing it.</p>
<p>Okay then, I guess I&#39;ll look at part two next and see if anything I&#39;ve made a guess about here is right at all.</p>
