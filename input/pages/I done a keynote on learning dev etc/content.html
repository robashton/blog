<p>Not a real blog entry (and I don&#39;t usually post when new videos come on) but it&#39;s such a rarity that I do a soft talk and I&#39;ve been told people like this one so...</p>
<p>I was asked to keynote At The Frontend (a new conference ran the day before Oredev by the organisers of Oredev) and this is what I came up with.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been drunk with me in the last few months I&#39;ll have talked about this crap anyway, but if you&#39;ve not then this is your chance to hear me waffle on about stuff that I&#39;ve realised in the last few months about how I&#39;ve wasted my last decade.</p>
