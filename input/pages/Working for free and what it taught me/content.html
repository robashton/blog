<p>All the way back in November I <a href="/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html">got fed up with the enterprise consulting lark</a> and because of that enterprise consulting lark I realised I had enough money to get by for a year without working quite easily.</p>
<p>Because I was so fed up, I decided I wanted to do something a bit different and because I like to meet new people and see new things, <a href="/entries/why-work-for-free.html">I offered up my time for free</a> providing my expenses were covered and I could therefore stretch a bit further.</p>
<p>In that time I worked for a number of companies across the globe, heading as far east as Israel and heading as far west as Hawaii (primarily for the surf), and had my plans not been altered by <a href="/entries/im-leaving-.net.html">finding a start-up I believe in</a> I would have probably ended up doing some work in Hong Kong and Australia too.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all very well and good, but what did I learn? Hippy stuff coming up.</p>
<h1>Experience in Tool/Language X is a stupid thing to ask for</h1>
<p>In all but one of my little engagements, I was handed some work to do where I&#39;d had pretty much zero engagement with the technology involved. The hardest of these was probably <a href="/entries/ometa-odata-odear---polishing-it-off.html">OMeta</a> which I blogged about - I had less than two weeks on site and I was asked to write a new feature in it. </p>
<p>I feel pretty confident in saying that if you give any motivated/experienced software developer a challenge in something they have never used before, then they&#39;ll get on that stuff and make it happen.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re hiring on the basis of &quot;3 years of .NET/Ruby/Mongo/Python/Boo&quot; then you&#39;re doing it wrong. If you&#39;re turning people down because they don&#39;t work in your chosen software stack you&#39;re doing it wrong.</p>
<h1>Take the bullshit away and let me get on with the job</h1>
<h1>Be one with the framework/team/system</h1>
<h1>You don&#39;t need any of that crap</h1>
<p>I lived out of a suitcase for this time and had to ruthlessly discard things that took up needless space. I had a trial run for the first few weeks where I tried to lug my Moka pot and coffee grinder around with me but sadly had to replace that with the spare laptop for doing .NET work.</p>
<p>What did I end up with after a few iterations of discard and re-pack?</p>
<ul>
<li>A week&#39;s worth of clothing</li>
<li>A MBA running Debian for doing most of my work</li>
<li>A heavy duty windows laptop for running Visual Studio</li>
<li>An iPad for reading on</li>
<li>Toothbrush/paste, shampoo and conditioner (I have long hair!)</li>
<li>iPhone + Headphones for communication and music</li>
</ul>
<p>So successful has this activity been, that even though I&#39;ve now been in my new job in London for a month I&#39;m still living out of this suitcase in a managed apartment and really not caring too much.</p>
<p>Okay, it&#39;s hardly a complete stripping down of &quot;material goods&quot;, and I&#39;m still lugging around several thousand pounds worth of Apple gear, but i</p>
