Back on the list of things "added to RavenDB" [during my time at Hibernating Rhinos](/entries/working-at-hibernating-rhinos.html), ever wished you could pass custom arguments to the transformer when performing a query in RavenDB?

Well, this has been asked for a number of times and since [splitting out results-transformers](/entries/ravendb-resulttransformers---a-new-way-of-looking-at-things.html') into their own process, it has become much easier to add this functionality.

What does this look like?
