<p>Back on the list of things "added to RavenDB" <a href="/entries/working-at-hibernating-rhinos.html">during my time at Hibernating Rhinos</a>, ever wished you could pass custom arguments to the transformer when performing a query in RavenDB?</p>

<p>Well, this has been asked for a number of times and since <a href="/entries/ravendb-resulttransformers---a-new-way-of-looking-at-things.html'">splitting out results-transformers</a> into their own process, it has become much easier to add this functionality.</p>

<p>What does this look like?</p>
