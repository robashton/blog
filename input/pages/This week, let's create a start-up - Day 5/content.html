<p><strong>This post was written on Friday</strong></p>
<p>Final day of &quot;<a href="entries/this-week,-lets-create-a-start-up.html">Build a start-up in a week</a>&quot;, how did we do?</p>
<p>Well, we deployed all assets to Amazon and ported across Sam&#39;s first customer from his original single-tenant system and everything works as expected. This work included lots of tidy up and &quot;making nice jobs&quot;, very little faffing :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sticking jPlayer into an iFrame so Sam could skin it </li>
<li>Write a migration script to take data from the original system and create an org for it in the new system</li>
<li>Setting up autoplay from the home page (so pressing play on a sermon would re-direct to the sermon page and play the sermon via jPlayer)</li>
<li>Fulltext search functionality on both the public site and the admin site through sermons</li>
<li>Adding the series info on the sermon viewing page</li>
<li>Styling</li>
</ul>
<p>Not very exciting, but all very trivial (even full text search)</p>
<p><em>Migration script</em></p>
<p>This just loaded the original data into memory as a string, de-serialized it into the old data types, copied it across into new data types, re-wrote ids across references and then called SaveChanges.</p>
<p>Didn&#39;t even bother using any of the bulk support in RavenDB as the amount of data was trivial, the dumb solution is sometimes the best- <em>next</em></p>
<p><em>Full text search</em></p>
<p>YAY RAVENDB</p>

}</code></pre><p>Can&#39;t argue with how easy that was, and it still all works with that original paging stuff I wrote on the first day.</p>
<p><em>Adding the series info for a sermon</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sermon <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> session.<span class="hljs-type">Load</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-type">Sermon</span>&gt;(id)
<span class="hljs-comment">// if null etc</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> series <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> session.<span class="hljs-type">Load</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-type">Series</span>&gt;(sermon.<span class="hljs-type">SeriesId</span>)</code></pre><p>Remember that ISecureDocumentSession <a href="/entries/this-week,-lets-create-a-start-up---day-4.html">I wrote yesterday</a>? That made the Include stuff hard to cater for on a Load, so I just do two load calls instead - in a more evolved system we&#39;d have to do this better somehow because it isn&#39;t going to scale across all the other usages that IDocumentSession can give us.</p>
<p>Instead I&#39;d look at hooking into RavenDB properly to do this security (either using its server-side security bundle, or adding appropriate extension points for this sort of filtering job on the client)</p>
<p>For this sort of thing though, it&#39;s two remote calls rather than one on a fairly low traffic system so it should be okay for now.</p>
<p><em>Deploying</em></p>
<p>Took 10 minutes to get onto Amazon thanks to Sam&#39;s efforts earlier in the week, and 5 minutes to replace the content on the old system with the script tag to import data from the new Truthvine system. (That&#39;s what the customer would have to do to use it)</p>
<p>If that&#39;s not easy I don&#39;t know what is. </p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC is surprisingly tolerable if you leave your opinions and a bit of brain-matter at the door on your way in, certainly it&#39;s pretty fine at throwing together a quick cruddy application on top of something simple like RavenDB.  Oh, and Razor is a thing of beauty - well done Microsoft for getting at least one thing right this past few years (Aww, just kidding, you know I love you really)</p>
<p>Mission accomplished and nothing in the solution is messy at all thanks to the no-crap atttitude of throwing things together that work in the simplest way possible.</p>
<p>I wish Sam luck on his start-up adventure and hope he finds enough clients to make the effort worthwhile, he&#39;s got a good project on his hands and I hope I&#39;ve given him the boost he needed to get going.</p>
