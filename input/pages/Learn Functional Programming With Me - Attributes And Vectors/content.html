<p>So last time I left the program, I had a black square which moved across the page but left a delightful black smear across the window, it looked something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blackline.png" alt="Black smear" title="" /></p>

<p>I promised I'd add keyboard input this time around, and I don't like to lie - so while I sit here at my client's rather amazing karting day I've decided to give adding this a go as I don't really like karting that much ;-).</p>

<p>First things first, I need to clear my screen in between frames or I'm going to keep on having an ugly black smear instead of a moving black square, in JS this would look like.</p>

<pre><code>context.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);
</code></pre>

<p>Not rocket science, right?</p>

<p>Well, right now, I have the function for drawing a square, which gets the context and draws a square, this looks like</p>

<pre><code>(defn drawSquare [x y w h]
  (let [target (.getElementById js/document "target")
        context (.getContext target "2d")]
    (.fillRect context x y w h)
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>Great, but in order to have the moving square, I'm going need that context more than once, and making multiple requests to get the context is a bad idea because it means lots of calls to the DOM (slow).</p>

<p>Clearly this means I'm going to need three functions for my purposes:</p>

<pre><code>(defn clearScreen [ctx]
  (.clearRect ctx 0 0 WIDTH HEIGHT)
)

(defn drawRect [ctx x y w h]
  (.fillRect ctx x y w h)
)

(defn context []
  (let [target (.getElementById js/document "target")]
  (.getContext target "2d"))
)
</code></pre>

<p>Meaning I can do</p>

<pre><code>(defn drawScene [x]
  (let [ctx (context)]
    (clearScreen ctx)
    (drawRect x 0 100 100)
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you'll have noticed (if you're actually paying attention), that I have a 'Width' and 'Height' parameter for clearScreen that I haven't bothered trying to filter - that's because they're attributes of the Canvas Element and I need to get the darned things from that element and I haven't worked out a clean way of passing these things around (or retrieving them all from a function so I have the values present at that time. (Remember that I am trying to avoid global state, and as far as I know I haven't got "Types" for storing collections of data in.</p>

<p>Okay - so first things first, how do I get attributes from an HTML element? HTML elements? Attributes? These aren't Clojure concepts - I can do a quick Google and see that this is possible:</p>

<pre><code>(. target -width)
</code></pre>

<p>According to the Wiki on Clojurescript, this is just part of the "host interop" featureset - I'm not entirely sure how this maps to typical Clojure.</p>

<p>Now - this still means I have the problem of how to get these out of a function, in JS I'd probably have something like</p>

<pre><code>var Rendering = function(element) {
  this.context = element.getContext('2d');
  this.width = element.width;
  this.height = element.height;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or something trite like that (see my other canvas codes in Github for what this actually looks like).</p>

<p>Can't do this here as far as I know, turns out I can return a vector, or a list or a set or something from a function (duh), so I can do something like</p>

<pre><code>(defn context []
  (let [target (.getElementById js/document "target")
    [
      (.getContext target "2d")
      (. target -width)
      (. target -height)
    ]
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>Which will return a vector containing</p>

<pre><code>[context width height]
</code></pre>

<p>I can pass this into my clearRect function for example with</p>

<pre><code>(defn drawScene [x]
  (let [ctx (context)]
    (clearScreen ctx)
    (drawRect x 0 100 100)
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>So nothing different here, but I'll need to unpack that vector in order to use it</p>

<pre><code>(defn clearScreen [ctx]
  (let [[context width height] ctx
    (.clearRect context 0 0 width height)
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a bit verbose, or doing a bit of research it appears I can automatically unpack that vector when I call the function ala</p>

<pre><code>(defn clearScreen [[context width height]]
  (.clearRect context 0 0 width height)
)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this, I'm just passing blobs of data around and assuming their structure in my functions - does Clojure have any inference over this stuff for verifiability (I'm not sure) - seems I'm losing a lot of the safety I'd have with OO constructs (regardless of type safety or whatever).</p>

<p>Either way, my complete program currently looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>(ns game)

(defn context []
  (let [target (.getElementById js/document "target")]
    [
      (.getContext target "2d") 
      (. target -width)
      (. target -height)
    ]
  )
)

(defn clearScreen [[ctx width height]]
  (set! (. ctx -fillStyle) "#FFF")
  (.clearRect ctx 0 0 width height) 
)

(defn drawSquare [[ctx width height] x y w h]
  (set! (. ctx -fillStyle) "#000")
  (.fillRect ctx x y w h) 
)


(defn tick [x]
  (let [ctx (context)] 
    (clearScreen ctx) 
    (drawSquare ctx x 0 100 100)  
    (if (&lt;= x 1000) 
      (js/setTimeout (fn []
        (tick (inc x)) 
      ) 33  )
    )
  )
)

(defn ^:export init []
  (tick 0) 
)
</code></pre>

<p>This has the effect of drawing a square, clearing the rect and drawing the square again, which means my square floats across the screen.</p>

<p>Seems I've once again run out of room to talk about input to this program from the keyboard, hopefully I'll reach that next entry!</p>

<p>I still have some pending questions from these two entries:</p>

<ul>
<li>The recursive setTimeout with the anonymous closure?</li>
<li>Passing that vector around - is this a good idea?</li>
</ul>

<p>Anybody feel free to chip in at any time.</p>
