<p>I&#39;m skimming through Cascalog for the Impatient and documenting my questions/learnings as I go for my future benefit.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/entries/impatiently-learning-cascalog---part-1.html">Part 1</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Part 2</h1>
<p>Apparently in this part we&#39;re going to update our first code so as to count the words in our document and that&#39;s the first step towards implementing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf*idf">tf-idf</a> implementation - cool story bro, I have no idea what one of those is but moving on.</p>
<p>I quite like the explanation given at the beginning of the article for why it&#39;s important that we be able to copy data from one place to another, and why we&#39;d use Cascalog for this. Basically we&#39;re talking about being able to make guarantees about this operation and that&#39;s going to be important when we&#39;re trying to write logic on top of this process.</p>
<p>So anyway, we&#39;re given the following code</p>
<pre><code class="lang-clojure"><span class="list">(<span class="title">defmapcatop</span> split <span class="collection">[line]</span>
  <span class="string">"reads in a line of string and splits it by regex"</span>
    <span class="list">(<span class="title">s/split</span> line #<span class="string">"[\[\]\\(\),.)\s]+"</span>)</span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>I guess that &#39;defmapcatop&#39; is a macro for defining map operations, and this appears to be splitting a line by whitespace.</p>
<p>Googling this doesn&#39;t appear to yield in the documentation, which is a bit unfortunate - but a bit of rummaging around finds a handy page for <a href="http://entxtech.blogspot.co.uk/2010/12/which-operation-def-macro-should-i-use.html">&quot;which def should I use&quot;</a>  which suggests that I&#39;m on the right track with that line of thought.</p>
<p>Okay, so we can move on from this pretty swiftly and see how we&#39;re going to use this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-clojure">(defn -main [in out &amp; args]
  (?&lt;- (hfs-delimited out)
       [?word ?count]
       ((hfs-delimited in :skip-header? true) _ ?line)
       (split ?line :&gt; ?word)
       (c/count ?count)))</code></pre>
<p>Well, I have to say I can barely read this - my Clojure-fu is not strong when mixed with the Cascalog.</p>
<p>But, we can see</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#39;re using the (?&lt;- thingy again, so we&#39;re running this query now</li>
<li>We&#39;re &#39;sinking&#39; our output, whatever that is to the &#39;out&#39; path</li>
<li>This time, we&#39;re outputting the variables &quot;word&quot; and &quot;count&quot;</li>
<li>We&#39;re reading in from &#39;in&#39;, to the variables &#39;_&#39; and &#39;?line&#39;</li>
<li>I guess we&#39;re using &#39;_&#39; because we&#39;re ignoring that</li>
<li>We split the line into the ?word variable</li>
<li>The :&gt; thingy seems to be a bit of magic to do that</li>
<li>And then we count that into the ?count variable</li>
</ul>
<p>I am mega-confused reading this because I can&#39;t actually tell how it maps to what I know about Clojure/Lisp.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s weird because our output is on top, and takes in the variables ?word and ?count which aren&#39;t defined yet</li>
<li>That&#39;s weird because despite the output at the top, our predicates are written in the order they&#39;re going to be run</li>
<li>It&#39;s weird because of that :&gt; thingy</li>
</ul>
<p>The way I understand the documentation is that Cascalog looks at the dependencies of each predicate and only runs them when they have been fulfilled. I guess the &#39;sink&#39; relies on ?word and ?count being available and isn&#39;t run until they are or something like that.</p>
<p>This is neatly explained by the Cascalog for the Impatient guide in terms of the &quot;logic programming&quot; paradigm so I&#39;ll accept that for now.</p>
<p>I suspect that the <em>(?&lt;-</em> thingy is actually a macro of some sort that re-writes this into something more sane, but who knows right?</p>
<p>Running this with</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">lein</span> uberjar
<span class="title">hadoop</span> jar ./target/impatient.jar <span class="typedef"><span class="keyword">data</span>/rain.txt output/wc</span></code></pre>
<p>Gives me a wonderful &quot;out of memory exception&quot;, so I post a dump on the mailing list and have a look at my environment.</p>
<p>Things I tried while I waited for a response</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-install the hadoop package (1.2.1) but the x64 version</li>
<li>Edit the configuration files to force 2048mb of heap size</li>
<li>Clear my hadoop installation again</li>
<li>Download the raw tar.gz for hadoop</li>
<li>Configure that</li>
<li>Run that: Success</li>
<li>Run it again, failure</li>
<li>Restart laptop for the fifth time</li>
<li>Everything works, QUICK DON&#39;T TOUCH IT ANY FURTHER</li>
<li>TLDR: I <em>still</em> really hate the JVM, or it hates me - whatever</li>
</ul>
<p>Side note: The project pages for Hadoop are <em>awful</em>, I had to go through a dozen links before I got to download anything - it felt like it was <em>trying</em> to make me feel stupid, but oh well - carrying on.</p>
<p>The real output?</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">A</span>    <span class="number">3</span>
Australia    <span class="number">1</span>
Broken    <span class="number">1</span>
California<span class="string">'s    1
DVD    1
Death    1
Land    1
Secrets    1
This    2
Two    1
Valley    1</code></pre>
<p>Etc - so I&#39;m happy enough with that.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still not <em>that</em> happy with the crazy syntax of the Clojure, I&#39;m grabbing at it and going with the rolling assumption that the logic-like-system is just a bunch of macros on top of vanilla Clojure and &quot;just works&quot;, so &quot;shut up and carry on Rob&quot;.</p>
<p>Onto part 3 then...</p>
