<p>I mentioned yesterday that there are some problems with how <a href="/entries/re-thinking-result-transformations-in-ravendb.html">result transformations work in RavenDB</a></p>
<p>In truth, there are no problems, but as <a href="http://twitter.com/ayende">@ayende</a> mentioned himself, feature intersection is causing issues for development in RavenDB.</p>
<p>What is this feature intersection? Well, we have a <em>lot</em> of features around indexes and queries now, and they&#39;re all touching and overlapping in all sorts of strange ways - this is hardly surprising, it happens to many well-used software projects with feature requests flying in every day and so many awesome ideas to implement.</p>
<p>The problem that result transformations were initially trying to solve (and I know, I helped implement them in a hotel lobby with Ayende a couple of years ago), were the question of &quot;joins&quot; across documents. Well - this worked well, and had the added bonus of being able to define the exact result shape coming back from RavenDB (pre-forming entire view models in a single query as it were).</p>
<p>That&#39;s great, and now we have the ability to do what we did yesterday with yet another feature, load document in map, like so:</p>
<pre><code>    public <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Ponies</span> :</span> AbstractIndexCreationTask&lt;Pony&gt;
    {
         public Ponies()
         {
                Map = <span class="keyword">from</span> pony <span class="keyword">in</span> ponies
                            let pet = LoadDocument(pony.id)
                            select new {
                                pony.Name,
                                pony.Colour,
                                pony.Trampstamp.
                                PetName = pet.Name.
                                PetSpecies = pet.Species
                            }
         }
    }</code></pre><p>This is kinda cool, although it has implications in complexity when it comes to the indexing and re-indexing of documents that isn&#39;t what this blog entry is about.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve ended up with information in the index which we might want as part of our output, and it&#39;s not immediately obvious how we&#39;re going to get that out, and this is also doing quite a bit of the work we might want to do with the result transformation phase. (Feature overlap)</p>
<ul>
<li>How about what happens if we have a standard view model that we want to return from a transform, but several different indexes we might query to do that?</li>
<li>What about what happens we want to do a result transform when performing a dynamic query?</li>
<li>And what if we want to use the stored data in index instead of transforming a loaded document?</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#39;ve actually got a few <em>niggles</em> around these functionalities too, existing as entries in the issue tracker (such as we don&#39;t ignore FieldsToFetch when performing a transform), and we&#39;ve ended up boolean flags to &quot;SkipTransformResults&quot;!!</p>
<p>In essence, it&#39;s a bit messy and there is one immediate step we can take to fix this - any takers on what that might be?</p>
