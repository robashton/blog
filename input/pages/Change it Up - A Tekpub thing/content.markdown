Just a small thing and a moderately embarassing one at that.

While I was in Hawaii towards the [end of my travels](/entries/i-am-interested-in-talking-about-work.html) this year, I got coralled into doing an interview about [why I did what I did](/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html) and what prompted me to take action about "changing things up".

If you know me personally, then there is probably not anything too new in this video, but if you're interested in the thought process behind "getting out of that rut" and you're considering doing something about it yourself, I've been told that this video will help :)

You can find it at Tekpub over at [http://tekpub.com/products/change-it-up](http://tekpub.com/products/change-it-up). If you haven't got a subscription then you should just go and get one, as Tekpub is pretty rad.
