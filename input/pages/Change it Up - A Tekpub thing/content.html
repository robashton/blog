<p>Just a small thing and a moderately embarassing one at that.</p>
<p>While I was in Hawaii towards the <a href="/entries/i-am-interested-in-talking-about-work.html">end of my travels</a> this year, I got coralled into doing an interview about <a href="/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html">why I did what I did</a> and what prompted me to take action about &quot;changing things up&quot;.</p>
<p>If you know me personally, then there is probably not anything too new in this video, but if you&#39;re interested in the thought process behind &quot;getting out of that rut&quot; and you&#39;re considering doing something about it yourself, I&#39;ve been told that this video will help :)</p>
<p>You can find it at Tekpub over at <a href="http://tekpub.com/products/change-it-up"><a href="http://tekpub.com/products/change-it-up">http://tekpub.com/products/change-it-up</a></a>. If you haven&#39;t got a subscription then you should just go and get one, as Tekpub is pretty rad.</p>
