In a shocking display of "planning ahead", I have decided to write an open letter to you, my future employer, about our future working relationship.

**What is this about?**

By the time July rolls around, I will have spent half a year travelling around [working for free](/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html), learning new technologies, picking up new skills and in general becoming a [happier person](/entries/a-note-on-working-hours-and-working-at-home.html).

I can't keep doing this forever, aside from the slow drip of money out of my bank accounts I will also start to miss being a part of something and want to get involved in things again.

I want to continue with at least an aspect of this as I move forward with my life, but I need to make this sustainable somehow and make the balance between financial security and life a good one.

**What I offer**

I write code, I write a *lot* of code, I have the ability to learn things *quickly* and start delivering early on after starting a new role and I am an enthusiastic sharer of ideas and opinions.

I am offering my nimble fingers and keen mind to anyone in the world, I can...

- Help build features, and teach at the same time
- Run workshops on JS (back-end or front-end), ASP.NET MVC and RavenDB
- Learn your platform and give constructive feedback over its use
- Help you move forward from your legacy issues
- Advise on your long-term architectural problems/goals

**What I ask for**
