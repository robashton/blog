<p>In a shocking display of "planning ahead", I have decided to write an open letter to you, my future employer, about our future working relationship.</p>

<p><strong>What is this about?</strong></p>

<p>By the time July rolls around, I will have spent half a year travelling around <a href="/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html">working for free</a>, learning new technologies, picking up new skills and in general becoming a <a href="/entries/a-note-on-working-hours-and-working-at-home.html">happier person</a>.</p>

<p>I can't keep doing this forever, aside from the slow drip of money out of my bank accounts I will also start to miss being a part of something and want to get involved in things again.</p>

<p>I want to continue with at least an aspect of this as I move forward with my life, but I need to make this sustainable somehow and make the balance between financial security and life a good one.</p>

<p><strong>What I offer</strong></p>

<p>I write code, I write a <em>lot</em> of code, I have the ability to learn things <em>quickly</em> and start delivering early on after starting a new role and I am an enthusiastic sharer of ideas and opinions.</p>

<p>I am offering my nimble fingers and keen mind to anyone in the world, I can...</p>

<ul>
<li>Help build features, and teach at the same time</li>
<li>Run workshops on JS (back-end or front-end), ASP.NET MVC and RavenDB</li>
<li>Learn your platform and give constructive feedback over its use</li>
<li>Help you move forward from your legacy issues</li>
<li>Advise on your long-term architectural problems/goals</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I ask for</strong></p>
