I'm asked quite often what I do on my downtime - which I have plenty of - well currently I'm

- Writing a [document database in Clojure](http://github.com/robashton/cravendb)
- Doing a [statistics course](https://www.coursera.org/course/stats1)
- [Trying to find new clients](/hire.html)

I tend to be pretty focused and don't do more than one thing at a time, here is a run-down from my day today.

**9AM**

I don't tend to set an alarm, but I'm usually out of the house by 9AM - I wake up fairly quickly in the morning and my brain tends to be ready for action before the rest of my body is.

I get a train from my current lodgings into Kings Cross and I get 

- An espresso from [Beanstalk](http://twitter.com/beanstalklondon)
- A really nice tea from [Good Proper Tea](https://twitter.com/goodpropertea) 

I usually at this point walk towards where I'm going to be working for the rest of the day, wherever that is - which is usually somewhere East London regardless of whether I have a client or not.

Today I walked down into Farringdon whilst supping my hot tea, this gives my body a chance to catch up with my brain to find out what each other are doing.

**10AM**

I always try to do a chore or two in the morning before I begin work, today I needed to set up a suit for hire as I've a wedding to attend to on Saturday, yesterday it was a bank appointment. These things need fitting in or I'll just drop them because I get too obsessed with the code I'm writing at this particular moment in time.

**10:30AM**

Work + Breakfast! I usually try to go into [Prufrock](http://www.prufrockcoffee.com/) for this, as they have the best coffee combined with good wifi, but sadly they were packed today so I went across the road to [Department of Coffee and Social Affairs](http://www.departmentofcoffee.co.uk/). I try not to scoff too much for breakfast and this is when I crank out my first code. Today I'm working on my document database as I have a week of downtime.

The rule generally is, code until the macbook has no more battery which is ~3 hours, and that is what I did today - running out of battery around 13:00PM, which conveniently is lunchtime as well.

The battery running out and the forced moving on ensures I have a break, I made quite a few commits to my database projecte this morning and I'm already getting pretty bleary eyed!

**13:00PM**
