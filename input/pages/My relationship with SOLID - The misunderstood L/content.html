<p>I imagine my statement yesterday that OCP is &quot;dead&quot; will be the big bomb out of all of these blog entries, but nevertheless we push forward and look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov substitution principle</a></p>
  <blockquote>
   If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e., objects of type S may be substituted for objects of type T) without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed, etc.)
  </blockquote>

<p>This is one of those cases where things <em>just make sense</em>, and yet people always have a hard time describing exactly what it is. I&#39;m probably not going to spend much time on it in this blog entry because it&#39;s really boring and I doubt I can do a better job of explaining it than anybody else.</p>
<p><em>Instead, my relationship with it..</em></p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ll start off by saying that day to day that Liskov means nothing to me, it&#39;s almost a rule that strictly applies itself to inheritance situations and because I&#39;m primarily these days working in langauges that don&#39;t have any real native inheritance mechamisms (prototype chaining doesn&#39;t really count), this isn&#39;t something that affects me.</p>
<p>Hell, you know what? When I&#39;m working in C# it is something that I don&#39;t run into because inheritance is generally something I don&#39;t use or take advantage of (because composition is usually simpler etc etc). You can&#39;t change the behaviour of an object through inheritance if you never use it.. right? :-)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I want an example anyway, and I want one we&#39;re all familiar with so I&#39;ll hit up the .NET framework, and while I can remember vague instances of being annoyed about violations in UI frameworks like WinForms those days a long behind me and I can&#39;t remember any of them.</p>
<p>Indeed it&#39;s actually hard to think of any examples of this in the .NET framework which aren&#39;t actually a violation of our next guideline (&quot;interface segregation&quot;),  and throughout the &quot;SOLID years&quot; if you look at other people&#39;s writing on this subject, most writings about Liskov are actually about Interface Segregation.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s hit up a commonly quoted example that is almost a violation and talk about it a little bit.</p>
<p><em>The oft-quoted Stream example</em></p>
<p>Looking at the design principles that produced it, the reasoning is quite clear about why the .NET team went in the direction they did with this one, let&#39;s expand and use a simplified version of the Stream class.</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> Stream {
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Read(Byte[] buffer, <span class="keyword">int</span> offset, <span class="keyword">int</span> amount) {}
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Write(Byte[] buffer) {}
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Seek(<span class="keyword">int</span> offset){}
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, the default behaviour of this is to throw an exception on any of those methods, and derived instances can do proper implementations of these, like so</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">FileStream</span> : <span class="title">Stream</span> {</span>
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Read(Byte[] buffer, <span class="keyword">int</span> offset, <span class="keyword">int</span> amount) { <span class="comment">// Read from the file }</span>
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Write(Byte[] buffer) { <span class="comment">// Write to the file }</span>
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Seek(<span class="keyword">int</span> offset){ <span class="comment">// Seek to a position within the file }</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>And maybe an implementation that reads from a HTTP request</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">HttpStream</span> : <span class="title">Stream</span> {</span>
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Read(Byte[] buffer, <span class="keyword">int</span> offset, <span class="keyword">int</span> amount) { <span class="comment">// Read from the file }</span>
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Write(Byte[] buffer) { throw <span class="keyword">new</span> NotSupportedException(); }
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Seek(<span class="keyword">int</span> offset){  throw <span class="keyword">new</span> NotSupportedException(); }
}</code></pre>
<p> Now, at this point if we were to pass around the Stream object to a method like this</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> ReadStreamIntoFile(<span class="keyword">string</span> filename, Stream stream);</code></pre>
<p>Then our two streams would work just fine. </p>
<p>However, if we were to pass the stream object into this method:</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> WriteFileIntoStream(<span class="keyword">string</span> filename, Stream stream);</code></pre>
<p>The FileStream would function correctly, and the HttpStream would throw a NotSupportedException.</p>
<p>This is why the Stream class is often quoted as an example, the derived instances change the behaviour in program-breaking ways.</p>
<p><em>However</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> Stream {
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keyword">bool</span> CanRead { <span class="keyword">get</span>; }
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keyword">bool</span> CanWrite { <span class="keyword">get</span>; }
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keyword">bool</span> CanSeek { <span class="keyword">get</span>; }

  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Read(Byte[] buffer, <span class="keyword">int</span> offset, <span class="keyword">int</span> amount) {}
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Write(Byte[] buffer) {}
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> Seek(<span class="keyword">int</span> offset){}
}</code></pre>
<p>The behaviour as described, is that if those properties return true, then the methods are safe to call, if they return false, they&#39;re not safe to call.</p>
<p>It&#39;s opaque, and feels a bit wrong - but we don&#39;t necessarily have a violation of Liskov and we&#39;re happy on this front. This is a good example of where the pragmatics of developer usage have overidden the following of arbitrary software-design &quot;rules&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Back to my relationship with Liskov</strong></p>
<p>I do not have a relationship with the Liskov substitution principle because I don&#39;t generally write code that has any sort of inheritance chain within it, but if I did - sometimes I guess I&#39;d end up in the situation like the above and that would be okay. I&#39;m okay with that for the most part.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Liskov is ultimately pretty boring, and unless you&#39;re writing code with lots of inheritance it isn&#39;t really a problem. Don&#39;t write code with lots of inheritance and keep this problem away from you. Winning.</p>
<p>As a design principle, I totally agree with it - changing derived classes behaviour is annoying, don&#39;t do it. Okay, sorted.</p>
