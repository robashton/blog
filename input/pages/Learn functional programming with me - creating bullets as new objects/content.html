<p>So far I have a fixed number of entities in my scene, which means the pattern</p>

<pre><code>logic(state) =&gt; newState
</code></pre>

<p>Has been working great for me, but how might I manage a variable number of these entities? How might I hook up the creation of these entities to keyboard input?</p>

<p>Well, actually I don't think it is going to be that hard - but we'll see as I give it a go...</p>

<p><strong>The basics once again</strong></p>

<p>The same deal as everything else so far (okay, my next entry might be on re-factoring all this to avoid duplication)</p>

<p><em>This is how we create a bullet</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn initBullet [x y w h]
 {
  :x x
  :y y
  :w w
  :h h
 }
)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Bullets logic is taking the current sequence of bullets and moving them on the vertical axis</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn bulletsLogic [state]
  (for [bullet (:bullets state)]
    {
      :x (:x bullet)
      :y (dec (:y bullet))
      :w (:w bullet)
      :h (:h bullet)
    }
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p><em>And I'm going to draw a black square for each bullet</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn bulletsRender [ctx state]
  (doseq [bullet (:bullets state)] 
    (let [{:keys [x y w h]} bullet]
      (drawSquare ctx x y w h "#000")
    )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>There is nothing special or new about the above, although I've dropped the 'let' (as compared to the enemies render function) and pulled the bullets out of the state as part of the doseq call.</p>

<p>My bullets to begin with?</p>

<p><em>Create an empty list (sequence)</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn initState []
 { 
   :direction 1
   :enemies (for [x (range 0 16 2)
                  y (range 0 8 2)]
              (initEnemy x y 20 20)
   )
   :player (initPlayer 200 430 20 20)
   :bullets '()
 } 
)
</code></pre>

<p>I found out how to do that on Google so I think it's right.</p>

<p><em>Calling the appropriate methods</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn doLogic [state]
  {
    :direction (directionLogic state)
    :enemies (enemiesLogic state)
    :player (playerLogic state)
    :bullets (bulletsLogic state)
  }
)

(defn renderScene [ctx state]
  (enemiesRender ctx state)
  (playerRender ctx state)
  (bulletsRender ctx state)
)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, all of this achieves the square root of diddly squat, although if I run the program it doesn't fall over in a heap pile of flames so that's pretty good going for all of this code.</p>

<p><strong>Hooking up some input events</strong></p>

<p>This is going to be pretty much the same deal as ever</p>
