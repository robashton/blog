<p>So I ended up picking this up again towards the end of March (yes I know, it's near the end of May now, I've ended up writing and doing a lot...)</p>

<p>This is where I was up to last time:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/entries/learn-functional-programming-with-me---a-mission-statement.html">Missing statement</a></li>
<li><a href="/entries/learn-functional-programming-with-me---drawing-a-square.html">Drawing a square</a></li>
<li><a href="/entries/learn-functional-programming-with-me---moving-the-square.html">Moving the square</a></li>
<li><a href="/entries/learn-functional-programming-with-me---attributes-and-vectors.html">Attributes and vectors</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And the Github repo is here: <a href="https://github.com/robashton/clojure-spaceinvaders">github.com/robashton/clojure-spaceinvaders</a></p>

<p>I advise you pop back and read those if you're just tuning in, as I've had to as well in order to start up again!</p>

<p><strong>Improving my workflow</strong></p>

<p>I'm writing this after I've learned a lot about managing my workflow to keep myself interested in tasks, and I'm writing this after writing a silly number of posts about writing an <a href="/entries/ometa-odata-odear---polishing-it-off.html">OData parser in OMeta</a>, which reminded me an awful of doing functional programming.</p>

<p>So, what have I done to make my life easier with this Clojure malarkey?</p>

<p>Well, I want faster feedback, I don't want to have to keep spawning up Java and I don't want any manaul build process.</p>

<p>Here is what I came up with (I know there is a repl and stuff, but I honestly just want to get some Clojure written at this stage and this seemed nice)</p>

<p>I'm using <a href="https://github.com/ibdknox/cljs-watch">cljs-watch</a>, and I've written a Makefile that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>default: build
all: build

build:
  cljsc game.cljs \
      '{:optimizations :simple :pretty-print true}' \
      &gt; ./game.js

develop:
  cljs-watch game.cljs \
    '{:optimizations :simple :pretty-print true :output-to "./game.js"}'
</code></pre>

<p>Hacky, but if I type "make develop", I can get on and write code without having to worry about compilation so I'm happier with life, now I just make changes and hit refresh and they're there.</p>

<p><strong>Reminding myself of where I was</strong></p>

<p><em>First off, I specify that I'm sticking this all in the namespace 'game'</em></p>

<pre><code>(ns game)
</code></pre>

<p><em>I define a method called 'context', which takes no args</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn context []
</code></pre>

<p><em>I let 'target' be thbe result of calling .getElementById (interop)</em></p>

<pre><code>  (let [target (.getElementById js/document "target")]
</code></pre>

<p><em>Return a 'vector' containing the context, the width, and the height</em></p>

<pre><code>    [
      (.getContext target "2d") 
      (. target -width)
      (. target -height)
    ]
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Define a function called clearScreen, taking in a vector of 'ctx, width, height' - see above</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn clearScreen [[ctx width height]]
</code></pre>

<p><em>Set a property on the context of fillStyle '#FFF'</em></p>

<pre><code>  (set! (. ctx -fillStyle) "#FFF")
</code></pre>

<p><em>Call clearRect on the context, with 0,0,width,height</em></p>

<pre><code>  (.clearRect ctx 0 0 width height) 
)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Same again, only parameterised so we're drawing a square</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn drawSquare [[ctx width height] x y w h]
  (set! (. ctx -fillStyle) "#FF0")
  (.fillRect ctx x y w h) 
)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Now we have a function called tick which will call clearScreen over and over again, with drawSquare over again</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn tick [x]
  (let [ctx (context)] 
    (clearScreen ctx) 
    (drawSquare ctx x 0 100 100)  
    (if (&lt;= x 1000) 
      (js/setTimeout (fn []
</code></pre>

<p><em>And every frame, we call tick with a new version of the state, in this case an increased 'x'</em></p>

<pre><code>        (tick (inc x)) 
      ) 33  )
    )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p><em>We export a function called 'init' so I can call this from JS and make the game happen</em></p>

<pre><code>(defn ^:export init []
  (tick 0) 
)
</code></pre>

<p>Wow. There is a lot to (re)-take in here.</p>

<p>First off, some observations</p>

<ul>
<li>Dom interop is horrible</li>
<li>I remember now that I had state issues, I think I had that question answered on Github though, so we'll have a look at that next</li>
</ul>

<p>ONWARDS WITH THIS PROJECT</p>
