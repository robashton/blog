<p>We&#39;ve got a basic model representing our &#39;book&#39;</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">
<span class="hljs-keyword">module</span> Books <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span>

<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-type">Book</span> = { <span class="hljs-title">isbn</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">String</span>
            , <span class="hljs-title">title</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">String</span>
            , <span class="hljs-title">author</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">String</span>
            }</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Which is pretty terribly exciting - the key thing to note here is that this is a plain ol&#39; record containing primitive types - this makes it pretty shareable as far as view models go (Let&#39;s ignore that we&#39;re using it for persistence here, demo code gonna demo code).</p>
<p>We&#39;ve shoved Books.purs into a folder called &#39;shared&#39; which has been softlinked from both the client and server directories, which means it will be separately compiled into JS And Purescript respectively.</p>
<p>There is a great library over in Purescript world called <a href="https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-simple-json">simple-json</a> which defines a <em>ReadForeign</em> and <em>WriteForeign</em> for these basic types, which means that the functions readJSON and writeJSON will do the back and forth between JSON and the Purescript types.</p>
<p>There is also (thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://github.com/purerl/purescript-simple-json">@nwolverson</a>, a port of this library exists on the Purerl side of things which works in exactly the same way, using <a href="https://github.com/talentdeficit/jsx">JSX</a> under the hood. This is a fairly common pattern across the Purerl world, and you&#39;ll see when browsing the org repos that a lot of the code from the JS Purescript world has been ported across with minimal changes so that the two worlds look as alike as possible.</p>
<p>So, in the previous post we loaded a list of Books out of our genserver in Cowboy and simply called writeJSON on it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">
<span class="hljs-meta"># Rest.contentTypesProvided (\req state -&gt; Rest.result (jsonWriter : nil) req state)</span>

<span class="hljs-title">jsonWriter</span> :: <span class="hljs-keyword">forall</span> a. <span class="hljs-type">WriteForeign</span> a =&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Tuple2</span> <span class="hljs-type">String</span> (<span class="hljs-type">Req</span> -&gt; a -&gt; (<span class="hljs-type">Effect</span> (<span class="hljs-type">RestResult</span> <span class="hljs-type">String</span> a)))
<span class="hljs-title">jsonWriter</span> = tuple2 <span class="hljs-string">"application/json"</span> (\req state -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Rest</span>.result (writeJSON state) req state)
</code></pre>
<p>If we open up the client code, we can see</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">
<span class="hljs-title">maybeBook</span> &lt;- <span class="hljs-type">H</span>.liftAff $ loadItem $ <span class="hljs-string">"/api/books/"</span> &lt;&gt; isbn

<span class="hljs-comment">-- where</span>

<span class="hljs-title">loadItem</span> :: <span class="hljs-keyword">forall</span> a. <span class="hljs-type">ReadForeign</span> a =&gt; <span class="hljs-type">String</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Aff</span> (<span class="hljs-type">Either</span> <span class="hljs-type">String</span> a)
<span class="hljs-title">loadItem</span> uri = <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
  response &lt;- <span class="hljs-type">AX</span>.get <span class="hljs-type">AXResponse</span>.string uri
  <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> response.body <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span>
     <span class="hljs-type">Left</span> err -&gt; pure $ <span class="hljs-type">Left</span> <span class="hljs-string">"No"</span>
     <span class="hljs-type">Right</span> json -&gt; pure $ bimap show identity $ readJSON json
</code></pre>
<p>That is all that is required to shift data between the server Purescript and the client Purescript which is pretty tidy indeed! Because we&#39;re using the same library, any custom implementations of <em>ReadForeign</em> and <em>WriteForeign</em> we might choose to write can then also be shared between the two.</p>
<p>Obviously sharing code between both client and server is something that should be entered into with caution, typically sharing a lot of business logic is the sign of a problem - but I can easily see us ending up in a world where we can start using Halogen on the server-side to pre-render HTML for serving to the client much in the same way that the ReactJS community have started doing similar with NodeJS.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll look at our bindings to Redis, to get a feel for what interop with &quot;native&quot; Erlang with FFI looks like.</p>
