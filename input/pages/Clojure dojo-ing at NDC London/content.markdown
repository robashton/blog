I'm sat at NDC London working on my presentation on a completely re-paved laptop and that's my entire day sorted for Wednesday.

However, there is *Thursday* and *Friday* and while there are a couple of sessions I'll probably attend, I think I'm going to sit/stand around near the Twilio coffee machine and give Clojure 101s to anybody who fancies doing something a bit different.

The format? Bring your laptop and let's get you set up with a working Clojure environment. Let's pull down something fun to work on and let's build something. 

Just come and find me, tweet me [http://twitter.com/robashton](@robashton) to find out where I am or otherwise holla.

If you don't have a laptop I'm happy to do some informal lessons on my own machine but obviously there is a limit to the number of people we can crowd around my laptop and how much we can engage on that.

Let's create some more Clojure devs!
