<p>I&#39;m sat at NDC London working on my presentation on a completely re-paved laptop and that&#39;s my entire day sorted for Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, there is <em>Thursday</em> and <em>Friday</em> and while there are a couple of sessions I&#39;ll probably attend, I think I&#39;m going to sit/stand around near the Twilio coffee machine and give Clojure 101s to anybody who fancies doing something a bit different.</p>
<p>The format? Bring your laptop and let&#39;s get you set up with a working Clojure environment. Let&#39;s pull down something fun to work on and let&#39;s build something. </p>
<p>Just come and find me, tweet me <a href="@robashton"><a href="http://twitter.com/robashton">http://twitter.com/robashton</a></a> to find out where I am or otherwise holla.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have a laptop I&#39;m happy to do some informal lessons on my own machine but obviously there is a limit to the number of people we can crowd around my laptop and how much we can engage on that.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s create some more Clojure devs!</p>
