Just the first basic example, up to the point where you call SaveChanges() for the first time, I can't even get past that point. The project won't build. It says that the namespace 'Raven' could not be found. It's strange because I added the reference, I added the using directive, and DocumentStore even shows up in IntelliSense (along with all the other RavenDB specific types). There are no errors (no squiggly lines) that show up. It only doesn't work when I select 'build'.I referenced all the dlls in the Raven.Client build, as you said.
