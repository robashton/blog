<p>After a week off in the Western Isles, I&#39;ve started a stint on my adventures working in Israel for <a href="http://hibernatingrhinos.com">Hibernating Rhinos</a>.</p>

<p>Most of you are familiar with this company, but for those that aren&#39;t, it&#39;s <a href="http://twitter.com/ayende">@ayende</a>&#39;s company, and they make the profilers for various ORMS and that document database we all love, <a href="http://ravendb.net">RavenDB</a>.</p>

<p>This is a good one for me,  I&#39;ve never been to Israel before so that&#39;s a big+1, I&#39;m already pretty familiar with the product and code-base having spent a while talking about it and contributing over the years - and as I&#39;ve just spent a holiday doing no code I&#39;m pretty excited to be getting some work done.</p>

<p>I made it through security at about 1am after being asked too many times &quot;what are you doing in Israel&quot; and being unable to think of a truthful answer that didn&#39;t make people suspicious. &quot;I&#39;m on a working holiday&quot; led to questions of payment and of course I&#39;m currently free as in beer so that&#39;s something I need to work on if I&#39;m going to any other countries with strict entry requirements.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve got a car while I&#39;m here and an apartment for the next week and I&#39;m doing work on RavenDB, what work you ask? Well, like any good employer, Ayende has created a to-do list and let me get on with it how I like.</p>

<p>I quite like this way of working, &quot;Here is a pile of stuff that needs doing, get to it and ask if you need any help&quot;, no long meeting to align on vision and share synergies with stakeholders, no complicated requirements document or architecture plans - just a list of bullet points and the expectation that I&#39;ll go and seek the information that I need to get the job done. (Managers take note!).</p>

<p>This is also a very productive way of working, I&#39;ll talk more about the actual work I&#39;m doing in the next post, but what I can say is that I&#39;ve cleared most of what I was expected to do in the whole time I&#39;m here in the first couple of days of arriving. That&#39;s what Getting Things Done is all about and it aligns well with my aims of working on travelling.</p>

<p>How we are working is nice, as I said - there is a to-do list, that&#39;s publicly visible on <a href="http://issues.hibernatingrhinos.com">issues.hibernatingrhinos.com</a> under the tag &quot;Rob&#39;s sprint&quot;, I&#39;m working off a fork of the main project and keeping a pull request open as I go through - the current pull request can be found <a href="https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb/pull/502">here</a>, and here is a screenshot of that so far:</p>

<p>And this is the issues list so far (green means &#39;done&#39;)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got plans of tourism on Friday and Saturday (Sunday is a work day in Israel - that&#39;s something new I found out), maybe I&#39;ll put some photos online of me floating in the dead sea.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll write about the actual work I&#39;m doing in the next few entries.</p>
