<p>If you're joing us after the bank holiday weekend in the UK, then we're on the Event Store and looking at Github data.</p>

</ul>

<p>I actually wrote all of these blog entries several months ago, and then queued them up because I wanted to get some real data before running my projections.</p>

<p><em>Problem: I ran the events into the store on my EC2 "small" instance and now have 25gb of data sat there to run projections over.</em></p>

<p>I can't actually run my projections on that much data on that small instance without either waiting for a bazillion years or taking everthing else down on that box.</p>

<p>I quickly realise that I'm not going to be able to push the next blog post out on time either way, and decide to write this post and have a look at what I need to do to move my data onto a new EC2 machine.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Create an AMI of the current EC2 instance</strong></p>

<p><img src="/img/create_ami.png" title="creating an AMI" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Create an xlarge instance from this AMI</strong></p>

<p><img src="/img/event_store.png" title="Creating xlarge" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Log in and give this instance access to the old instance</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>ssh-keygen <em>etc</em></li>
<li>copy the public key and add it to the old EC2 authorized_keys</li>
<li>ssh from new machine to old machine to make sure it works</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 4: Get that data onto the new machine</strong></p>

<p>This is interesting, if you look in the folder I pointed the EventStore at to store its information it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/data_storage.png" title="raw files for storage"></p>

<p>Apparently all I have to do is copy this folder over and I do this with SCP like so</p>

<p><img src="/img/backing_up.png" title="backing up" /></p>

<p>And then I'm able to run the already-built event store because that came with the AMI I made. Everything works great and I celebrate.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Wait</strong></p>

<p>There may be some gaps in my blog entries from this point on as I run the projections over the events to get the results, there is a lot of data and patience is required...</p>
