<p>When I <a href="/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html">put out a call</a> for takers on my offer to come work for a week or so for <em>free</em>, I had more than a few people say "but what can you achieve in a week!?", or "the most you can be is a hit and run consultant in that time".</p>

<p>First off, consultancy is a dirty word, I'm not a hit and run consultant, <em>I actually build stuff</em>.</p>

<p>Secondly, I strongly believe that when you're working long term for a company that you see things differently and that an outside perspective or a fresh injection of <em>action</em> can make some real impact and accelerate things.</p>

<p>Why is this? Because when you're at a company for a while you get sucked into the inevitable drama of Meetings, Politics, Support and the Corporate Reality Distortion Field. </p>

<p>When you're working long term for a company, the little things become important and can feel like it takes an age to "align" on petty decisions and it can take longer to start on a piece of work than it can to simply iterate on that piece of work several times over. </p>

<p>When you're working long term for a company, you're trying to balance the deadlines against burning yourself out and that's actually surprisingly hard.</p>

<p>When you're an external guy, you're oblivious to all of this, you've got nobody coming up to you to ask you questions because they're too lazy to simply use Google, you've got nobody coming up to you to ask about that piece of code you wrote 2 years ago because they're too lazy to RTFM or RTFC (the C stands for code, work it out) and unless the company has some <em>really</em> serious issues you have little place inside those dreaded meetings.</p>

<p>When you're the external guy, and you're working alternating weeks, you can be as intense as you like for that work period because there is downtime coming straight after. (If you plan it anyway!)</p>

<p>When I turned up at <a href="http://hibernatingrhinos.com/">Hibernating Rhinos</a>, I was presented with a hit list, a working computer and a supply of coffee.</p>

<p>In 7 days, <strong>this</strong> is what we got done:</p>

</ul>

<p>Now, I'll admit that some of the taxes on these items have not been paid, and that's the hit and run aspect of the job. These taxes include some of the tidying around the edges of these tasks (such as verifying the API for everything is written for the async interfaces, or adding buttons to the Admin Studio), but the challenging aspect of driving the vertical stake end-to-end through the features (complete with tests) has been done and the challenging questions have been debated and answered.</p>

<p>Is this sort of productivity maintainable? Could I do this all of the time? No - I cannot, I am not superhuman (although I wish I was), but if you give me a list of stuff you need doing, a working computer, coffee and a week or two to get on with it? I'll Help Get Stuff Done. </p>

<p>When I go back to working for clients for money again, I'll be applying the lessons learned from this sort of effort and with the free work I have lined up still I suspect many more of these lessons are to come.</p>
