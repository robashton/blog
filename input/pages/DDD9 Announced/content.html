
		<p>Just a quick hello to point out that <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/ddd9/ProposedSessions.aspx">DDD9</a> has been announced for the 29th of January 2011 - and I've already submitted a couple of what I think are useful sessions for it.</p>

<p>I'm also due to talk at <a href="http://nhday.eu/en.aspx">NHDay</a> in Bologna on the 9th of October on the subject of model-first development on top of NHibernate/FluentNHibernate, and at Cheltenham <a href="http://grou.ps/digitalks/talks/5059459">DigiTalks</a> on the 5th of October, covering RavenDB in 15 minutes (by request, it'll be very toned down though).</p>

<p>Product at work is nearly done and I'll be returning to blog duties when that has come to a close</p>
