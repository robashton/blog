One of the wonderful benefits of MVC is the ability to use custom view engines. Ours searches for views in a client-specific set of folders and then if it doesn't find them, a default set of folders. This gives us the ability to customize a view per-client while still maintaining the same code base for everyone else.\r\n\t\t\t\t"},{"author":{"name":"robashton","avatar":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b6a6693f03003f7ab0f9b0882e9c2dde&size=50&default=identicon"},"date":"(2/3/2010 3:25 PM)","text":"\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm getting there, but views are only a small part of the story so I'm having to write it in chapters ;-)\r\n\t\t\t\t"},{"author":{"name":"Asad Ali Butt","avatar":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fa8925305aa1a75a20528d9334d739a3&size=50&default=identicon"},"date":"(3/14/2010 7:29 PM)","text":"\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat and very informative. do appriciate\r\n\t\t\t\t"},{"author":{"name":"Trent","avatar":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d0dab5fda667ffca2cb25c915e631508&size=50&default=identicon"},"date":"(4/5/2010 12:23 PM)","text":"\r\n\t\t\t\t\they Rob at the end of this series will you be compiling it into a PDF with source code??\r\n\t\t\t\t"},{"author":{"name":"robashton","avatar":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b6a6693f03003f7ab0f9b0882e9c2dde&size=50&default=identicon"},"date":"(4/5/2010 12:34 PM)","text":"\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIs it worth doing that? \r\n\t\t\t\t"},{"author":{"name":"Jamie","avatar":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3bbcd006fa90d27753a4699111bb0a7e&size=50&default=identicon"},"date":"(6/8/2010 7:27 AM)","text":"\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHi Rob, just like to say this is a very interesting tutorial. We've done something similar at my work, we tried a few of the \"workflow\" technologies and MEF to support this but in the end, we went with a solution quite similar to yours. It has one fundamental flaw though, versioning. At the moment there is no way to support different versions of the assembly within the same process (without appdomain) and get the view and controllers to use that particular appdomain. I wondered whether you had come across the problem and had solved it?Jamie\r\n\t\t\t\t"},{"author":{"name":"robashton","avatar":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b6a6693f03003f7ab0f9b0882e9c2dde&size=50&default=identicon"},"date":"(6/8/2010 7:38 AM)","text":"\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'll disappoint you here and say that when I saw this as an issue, my solution was just to ensure that I never had different versions of assemblies.If I deploy code for one tenant, I deploy the code for the rest of the tenants too and do a full build, so I never get version mismatches.\r\n\t\t\t\t"},{"author":{"name":"Jamie","avatar":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3bbcd006fa90d27753a4699111bb0a7e&size=50&default=identicon"},"date":"(6/8/2010 1:23 PM)","text":"\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAhh well. Our hope is to be able to run C# 3.5 and 4.0 side by side which would obviously be different versions of assemblies (with the ability to do it with third party products as well).What we aren't wanting is to have an upgrade nightmare as a new \"module\" comes out, with other modules becoming incompatible.
