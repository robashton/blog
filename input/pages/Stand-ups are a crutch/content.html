<p><em>PUB RANT TIME</em></p>
<p>You know the feeling, you&#39;re hacking away on some feature on the to-do list, having a conversation about it with the team in the team-chat of your preference and perhaps you&#39;re dancing to some of your favourite music whilst you flick between the two. You are in the zone.</p>
<h1>Hey, <em>everyone</em>, stand-up time</h1>
<p>Boom, just like that you&#39;re back to reality and detaching yourself from your game zone. You&#39;re breaking that conversation, you&#39;re turning off the music and worst of all you&#39;re leaving your <em>flow</em> so you can all talk about what everybody knows already because they&#39;ve been talking about it the whole time they&#39;ve been working.</p>
<h3>At one end of the spectrum</h3>
<p>Stand-ups in already-effective teams are at best a way to force some meat-space interaction between team members, and at worst a harmful distraction costing you hours of productivity in return for very little that couldn&#39;t have been achieved in the course of conversation over a beer at lunch.</p>
<p>In a good team, folk will have been pairing and watching the pull requests come in - people who aren&#39;t doing anything will tell you they aren&#39;t doing anything. People who are stuck will tell you that they&#39;re stuck. If someone isn&#39;t doing these things other developers will call them out on it because it&#39;s pretty obvious that nothing has come from their corner for a while.</p>
<p>In short an effective team doesn&#39;t need this crap because they&#39;re already <em>doing</em> what they should be doing - getting work done and sharing information about the work they&#39;re doing.</p>
<h3>At the other end of the spectrum</h3>
<p>In teams that aren&#39;t being effective, stand-ups are often used as a way to force some mumblings out of developers towards what they&#39;ve done and what they&#39;re doing today - and usually that&#39;s pretty much all you&#39;ll get out of them because they sure as hell don&#39;t want to admit they&#39;ve just been pushing code around this week.</p>
<p>Once they&#39;re back in their seats, they&#39;ll still not talk, they&#39;ll still not interact because hey, they had a stand-up and can get back to pushing meaningless code around.</p>
<p>Worst of all with daily stand-ups, crap teams with crap people on them won&#39;t even do any work before that organised daily stand-up because hey - the stand-up is coming and they don&#39;t want to be interrupted right? But you can&#39;t start the stand-up until everyone is there so everybody ends up starting work at 10am - <em>golf clap</em>.</p>
<h2>Don&#39;t work at the wrong end of the spectrum</h2>
<p>Fine, you&#39;re in a crap team - go and make it a not-crap team. I&#39;m not here to tell you how to do that, plenty of team management gurus are out there charging their thousands of dollars in order to give you a penny of their thoughts. I can tell you from experience that stand-ups won&#39;t fix your communication problems because in my experience they&#39;ll just get used as an excuse <em>not to communicate the rest of the time</em>. </p>
<p>Or accept you&#39;re in a crap environment and carry on doing whatever. This blog post is not for you.</p>
<h2>If you are the better end of the spectrum you don&#39;t need that stand-up</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve given up working for people who work at the wrong end of the spectrum, I&#39;m not working for crappy enterprise companies that have all of their other bullshit problems as well - I&#39;m hopefully never doing it again. My flitting about and <a href="/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html">working for free</a> shone the light on the harm that was causing me.</p>
<p>Hopefully you&#39;ve made that call too at some point - well done you beat me to it, now think about why you&#39;re still having those stand-ups and who they&#39;re for. Are they for you and the team or are they for somebody else and is there another way you can get them that information?</p>
<p>In the modern age of distributed and online team-work, purposefully stopping what everybody is doing so they can stand in some sort of daily ritual circle is just plain bizarre.</p>
