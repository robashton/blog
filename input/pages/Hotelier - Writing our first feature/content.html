<p>Now I've <a href="/entries/hotelier---setting-up-the-project.html">got the RavenDBs everywhere</a>, it is time to have a look at writing our first feature.</p>

<p>Let's start off with hotels, I want a new customer to be able to hit the front-page of the website and start creating their hotel with no registration or anything being required.</p>

<p>First off then, let's throw up the home page, I'm not going to bother with styling but I'll make sure to use a Razor Layout page so I can deal with that later (did somebody say Twitter Bootstrap?)</p>

<p>So that's</p>

<pre><code>View: /Views/Home/Index
Controller: /Controllers/HomeController
</code></pre>

<p>This is my first compromise on behalf of ASP.NET MVC, I'd prefer to have my controller, view and any other associated information all grouped together in a folder called "Home" instead of this weird horizontal partition.</p>

<p>However, I know from past experience that while playing with this is possible, it's not a route I want to pursue if I want to get things done now. I can change this later when it gets <em>really</em> annoying and I've had the feedback from my client that the work I've seen is okay.</p>

<p>I'll also create</p>

<pre><code>View: /Views/Hotels/Create
Controller: /Controllers/HotelsController
</code></pre>

<p>This is another compromise, I much prefer having controllers which aren't actually controllers ala NodeJS</p>

<pre><code>app.get('/hotel/create', function(req, res) { // controller code here }
</code></pre>

<p>And having the route as part of that set-up, separation of these concepts is clunky and weird and I don't like it. (Yes nancy boys, I know I can do this with your framework, not the point of this exercise)</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm gonna create a model for this in my app, which is to say</p>

<pre><code>public class Hotel { 
  public string Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Description { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm making a few assumptions ahead of time here and I've not written any tests, I've mapped this out in my head and the way it works is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Customer hits front page</li>
<li>Customer goes "get set up now!!" as he's excited by my exclamation marks</li>
<li>Customer gets to create a hotel which looks like the above</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll notice I use K+R style braces, I'm a convert and I've un-checked all boxes in Visual Studio that say "New line after.." - moar context on my screen yes please.</p>

<p>That's enough text for now, tomorrow I'll hook all these things together and write a test or two.</p>

<p>The code at this point can be found <a href="https://github.com/robashton/hotelier/tree/235d96b0314c22ca81a9000ad628a2a7678c13e4">here</a>.</p>
