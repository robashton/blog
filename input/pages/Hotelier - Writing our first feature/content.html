<p>Now I&#39;ve <a href="/entries/hotelier---setting-up-the-project.html">got the RavenDBs everywhere</a>, it is time to have a look at writing our first feature.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start off with hotels, I want a new customer to be able to hit the front-page of the website and start creating their hotel with no registration or anything being required.</p>
<p>First off then, let&#39;s throw up the home page, I&#39;m not going to bother with styling but I&#39;ll make sure to use a Razor Layout page so I can deal with that later (did somebody say Twitter Bootstrap?)</p>
<p>So that&#39;s</p>
<pre><code><span class="attribute">View</span>: <span class="string">/Views/Home/Index</span>
<span class="attribute">Controller</span>: <span class="string">/Controllers/HomeController</span></code></pre>
<p>This is my first compromise on behalf of ASP.NET MVC, I&#39;d prefer to have my controller, view and any other associated information all grouped together in a folder called &quot;Home&quot; instead of this weird horizontal partition.</p>
<p>However, I know from past experience that while playing with this is possible, it&#39;s not a route I want to pursue if I want to get things done now. I can change this later when it gets <em>really</em> annoying and I&#39;ve had the feedback from my client that the work I&#39;ve seen is okay.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll also create</p>
<pre><code><span class="attribute">View</span>: <span class="string">/Views/Hotels/Create</span>
<span class="attribute">Controller</span>: <span class="string">/Controllers/HotelsController</span></code></pre>
<p>This is another compromise, I much prefer having controllers which aren&#39;t actually controllers ala NodeJS</p>
<pre><code>app.<span class="keyword">get</span>(<span class="string">'/hotel/create'</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(req, res) { <span class="comment">// controller code here }</span></code></pre>
<p>And having the route as part of that set-up, separation of these concepts is clunky and weird and I don&#39;t like it. (Yes nancy boys, I know I can do this with your framework, not the point of this exercise)</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;m gonna create a model for this in my app, which is to say</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Hotel</span> {</span> 
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">string</span> Id { <span class="keyword">get</span>; <span class="keyword">set</span>; }
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">string</span> Name { <span class="keyword">get</span>; <span class="keyword">set</span>; }
  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">string</span> Description { <span class="keyword">get</span>; <span class="keyword">set</span>; }
}</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;m making a few assumptions ahead of time here and I&#39;ve not written any tests, I&#39;ve mapped this out in my head and the way it works is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer hits front page</li>
<li>Customer goes &quot;get set up now!!&quot; as he&#39;s excited by my exclamation marks</li>
<li>Customer gets to create a hotel which looks like the above</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#39;ll notice I use K+R style braces, I&#39;m a convert and I&#39;ve un-checked all boxes in Visual Studio that say &quot;New line after..&quot; - moar context on my screen yes please.</p>
<p>That&#39;s enough text for now, tomorrow I&#39;ll hook all these things together and write a test or two.</p>
<p>The code at this point can be found <a href="https://github.com/robashton/hotelier/tree/235d96b0314c22ca81a9000ad628a2a7678c13e4">here</a>.</p>
