<object width="1280" height="720"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/mp_nxjhx6yY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/mp_nxjhx6yY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="1280" height="720" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></object>

<p>This is a time-lapse of me creating a game over 48 hours (a weekend), overall there is about 30 hours of screen-time packed into 3 minutes of video - it's cool to see how the game and code progress over those 30 hours.</p>

<p>What is interesting is how I always have the social elements open in a browser window on my left hand side, I'd never noticed it before - I don't think it slowed me down any - the pauses where I wasn't coding I was up making coffee or thinking about a problem</p>

<p>Still, it would be interesting to see how I'd get on without it if I was doing another of these - the next rendition of the competition is next March and I think I'll be doubling my efforts to create something cool - I might even go as far as to do a 3D effort in WebGL</p>
