<p>As well as <a href="/entries/writing-an-odata-parser---starting-at-the-beginning.html">addressing resources</a> and <a href="/entries/parsing-odata---nested-resource-paths.html">resource paths</a>, in OData we apparently have the ability to invoke "service operations" as well.</p>

<p>From what I see, these are addressed in a pretty much identical manner to actual resources like so</p>

<pre><code>/ProductsByColor?color='red'
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>/ProductsByColor(3)/Category/Name?color='red'
</code></pre>

<p>The invocation on the server is the same in each of these cases, however in the second case we're addressing into the collection returned by the invocation.</p>

<p>Now, a simple solution to this will be to carry on using the existing parser, and supply these custom params as part of the overall model:</p>

<p>So, with the following test:</p>

<pre><code>test("/method(1)/child?foo=bar", function(result) {
  it("should have the resource specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.resource, 'method')
  })
  it("The result should be addressed", function() {
     assert.equal(result.key, '1')
  })

  it("should have the path specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.next.resource, 'Child')
  })

  it("should have the argument specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.args.foo, 'bar')
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>I might then solve it by simply adding this to the end of my main expression</p>

<pre><code>OData = (
  (
    PathSegment:model 
    (
      '?'
      OperationParam:param
    )?
</code></pre>

<p>Where</p>

<pre><code>OperationParam = 
  Text:name '=' Text:value -&gt; { name: name, value: value }
,
</code></pre>

<p>(Text is a hack so I'm not putting that here until I've defined what it actually is - similar to my kerfuffle over resource names earlier)</p>

<p>To build up the model we can do some inline code like so:</p>

<pre><code>OData = (
  (
    PathSegment:model 
    (
      '?'
      OperationParam:param
    )?
  ) -&gt; { 
          if(param) {
           model.args = {}
           model.args[param.name] = param.value;
          }
         return model
       }
  | '/'
) 
</code></pre>

<p>This will have the desired effect to an extent, of course it won't pass this test:</p>

<pre><code>test("/method(1)/child?foo=bar&amp;foz=baz", function(result) {
  it("should have 'foo' specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.args.foo, 'bar')
  })
  it("should have 'foz' specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.args.foz, 'baz')
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>This is where the built-in 'listOf' comes in useful:</p>

<pre><code>OData = (
  (
    PathSegment:model 
    (
      '?'
      listOf(`OperationParam, '&amp;'):params
    )?
</code></pre>

<p>With an appropriate loop to build up the list</p>

<pre><code>OData = (
  (
    PathSegment:model 
    (
      '?'
      listOf(`OperationParam, '&amp;'):params
    )?
  ) -&gt; { 
          if(params) {
           model.args = {}
           for(var i in params)
             model.args[params[i].name] = params[i].value;
          }
         return model
       }
  | '/'
) 
</code></pre>

<p>Now, a few things getting wrong with this whole implementation so far...</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a semantic difference between a Service Operation and a Resource look-up, I'm not expressing this in the model</li>
<li>The code to build up the model is getting a bit mixed into my parsing expressions, I'll watch to see if this  gets un-manageable</li>
<li>I've not done 'Text' implementation properly</li>
<li>I've not done 'ResourceName' implementation properly</li>
</ul>

<p>I can live most of this for now - but I've made a note that they're making me uncomfortable so when my progress is at a suitable point I can deal with them.</p>
