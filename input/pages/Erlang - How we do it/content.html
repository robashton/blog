<p>Having <a href="/entries/the-ashton-disinterest-curve---c.html">established</a> that I <a href="/entries/the-ashton-disinterest-curve---javascript-and-node.html">apparently</a> <a href="/entries/the-ashton-disinterest-curve---clojure.html">hate</a> <a href="/entries/the-ashton-disinterest-curve---erlang.html">everything</a>, let&#39;s get a bit more constructive and go over how at the company I work at, we do Erlang and do Erlang effectively.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start off with a little history first though to build context for this series... I&#39;ll use &quot;we&quot; a lot, but what I really mean is &quot;me and my current understanding of our way&quot;.</p>
<h1 id="where-we-are">Where we are</h1>
<p>There were a couple of .NET developers, and they had need to build a distributed system and they looked at .NET and went &quot;hell no, let&#39;s do that little bit in Erlang&quot; and then a little bit later &quot;Oh sod it, let&#39;s do everyting in Erlang this is actually great&quot;. Lots of mistakes were made over the next few years and they were learned from as they were made. Eventually a developer called Rob (me) joined the team and most of the important mistakes had already been made and a lot of decisions had been made about how best to be effective at Erlang development.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve been through our own custom build systems/runners, to using <a href="https://github.com/rebar/rebar">Rebar</a>, to using fairly <a href="https://github.com/ninenines/erlang.mk">poorly written</a> Makefiles to using <a href="https://github.com/fenollp/erl-mk">reasonably written</a> Makefiles to just forking the best one and making it <a href="https://github.com/id3as/erl-mk">our own</a>. We&#39;ve been through the &quot;let&#39;s make everything a gen server&quot; to &quot;why do we need gen servers anyway&quot; to &quot;okay, here is the happy medium&quot;. We&#39;ve had bash scripts lying around a bunch of projects for automation purposes that have diverged from each other, converged again and been merged into a &quot;<a href="https://github.com/robashton/vir">single tool to rule them all</a>&quot;. We have sensible ways to build up APIs between gen servers, between running applications and we have a common swiss army knife of a common library that every time I go to write Erlang without for personal stuff I wonder how on earth I ever got on without.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a pretty mature stack and because we own most of it outside of our basic dependencies we&#39;re not subject to the whims of third parties changing their minds about how projects should be written and managed. Leaning on a large platform like Erlang is relaxing because it has been around for a few decades and generally doesn&#39;t undergo massive shifts every year just because some hipster somewhere decides they don&#39;t like <em>that sort</em> of paren or semi-colon.</p>
<p>We&#39;re pretty much against package managers, binary dependencies or other opaque tooling that we can&#39;t understand and simply make our own. We&#39;ve learned the hard way that sometimes the best tools are the ones that we&#39;ve all been using since the dawn of time (Bash and Make) and slowly over time these ideas have converged and become crystalised as a standard set of tools we all understand and are happy with.</p>
<h1 id="a-series-then">A series then</h1>
<p>So we have these bash scripts and makefiles and our standard application structure and while we&#39;ve been using them for years in various forms we&#39;ve never really publicised that they&#39;re actually OSS on Github. We&#39;ve never talked about how to use them to build Erlang applications (new starters? Pair for half a year and you&#39;ll have it all down like second nature anyway).</p>
<p>Now that most of this has stabilised (for now), it&#39;s quite a good time to write a blog series about our workflow, how to bootstrap a new application, how to do builds and releases and best practises around gen servers and processes and APIs and inter-process communication. We&#39;re also heavy Docker users (for now) so I&#39;ll cover our loose workflow around how we use that for development etc.</p>
<p>On board? The next entry will be about bootstrapping an empty application.</p>
