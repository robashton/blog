<p>So, in our little foray into LevelDB, we've uncovered the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>We can do <a href="/entries/basic-operations-with-leveldb.htm">atomic writes</a></li>
<li>We can have <a href="/entries/transactional-guarantees-on-top-of-leveldb.html">consistent reads</a>, </li>
<li>We can create a <a href="/entries/writing-a-transaction-manager-on-top-of-leveldb.html">transaction manager</a> on top of LevelDB </li>
<li>We can can <a href="/entries/streaming-large-values-from-leveldb.html">stream data out of LevelDB</a></li>
<li>And we can create <a href="/entries/secondary-indexes-on-top-of-leveldb.html">secondary indexes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>With this, I set about creating a fork of RavenDB with a starting implementation of LevelDB for document storage.</p>

<p>I grabbed the <a href="https://github.com/meebey/leveldb-sharp">C# bindings</a> from Github and set about re-implementing my in-memory transaction manager on top of them.</p>

<p>The first thing I notice about the C# bindings is that the API looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>string value = db.Get(string key)
db.Put(string key, string value)
</code></pre>

<p>This is not what <a href="/entries/streaming-large-values-from-leveldb.html">RavenDB wants</a>, what RavenDB wants is a MemoryStream or at the very least a ByteArray - as it is not in the business of pushing large strings around the place in managed memory.</p>

<p>No problem, I fork the original project and set about addding Byte array support and then notice something.</p>

<p><em>The bindings are using the C API for LevelDB</em> (which makes sense if you're going to support cross platform C#), but more importantly the C API looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>char* leveldb_get(char* key)
</code></pre>

<p>See that return result? That's a malloc, what does the LevelDB C# code do?</p>

<pre><code> var value = Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi(valuePtr, (int) valueLength);
 return value;
</code></pre>

<p>Ignoring the <a href="https://github.com/meebey/leveldb-sharp/issues/2">memory leak</a>, as it's a known issue and an easy mistake to make, we can see we're copying the data out of the unmanaged array into a managed string via the PtrToStringAnsi call.</p>

<p>What does the C api do?</p>

<pre><code>Status s = db-&gt;rep-&gt;Get(options-&gt;rep, Slice(key, keylen), &amp;tmp);
if (s.ok()) {
  *vallen = tmp.size();
  result = CopyString(tmp);
} else {
  *vallen = 0;
  if (!s.IsNotFound()) {
    SaveError(errptr, s);
  }
}
return result;
</code></pre>

<p>And CopyString?</p>

<pre><code>static char* CopyString(const std::string&amp; str) {
  char* result = reinterpret_cast&lt;char*&gt;(malloc(sizeof(char) * str.size()));
  memcpy(result, str.data(), sizeof(char) * str.size());
  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>urk</em></p>

<p>In order to get a stored document from LevelDB, the following operations are performed:</p>

<pre><code>- Internally, LevelDB will load the document into memory
- Internally, LevelDB will copy that memory into a string on a Get call
- The C API copies that memory into a mallocced byte array
- The C# API copies that memory into a managed string (probably on the Large Object Heap)
</code></pre>

<p>What we have here, is a C# wrapper around a C API that is a wrapper around a C++ API, and each of them is trying to be semantically equivalent to the underlying API - and the abstraction is <em>killing us</em>.</p>

<p>For small values, this probably isn't a big deal, but RavenDB documents can be any size, and RavenDB documents often <em>are</em> any size - ideally what we want is</p>

<pre><code>MemoryStream stream = db.Get(string key)
</code></pre>

<p>Where that stream reads from the start of an unmanaged array to the end of that unmanaged array and then disposes it.</p>

<p>In essence, the job of getting LevelDB into RavenDB is going to involve writing a new C API for LevelDB specific to our needs, then writing a C# API around that API specific to our needs.</p>

<p>Thankfully we need about 10% of the exposed functionality in LevelDB so our job isn't as hard as "writing a set of managed bindings for LevelDB", but this means that I won't have time to do this before I leave Israel.</p>

<p>I put my sad face on and get to work on something more manageable for my final day of work :-(</p>
