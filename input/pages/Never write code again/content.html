<p>I was in a bar last night and one of my ex-colleagues openly admitted that his job is pretty much just copying code from Stackoverflow into Visual Studio.</p>
<p>I jokingly suggested that he could probably automate that and spend the rest of his day looking at pictures of cats on Reddit, and thus the idea of a &quot;ctrl-rob&quot; key was born, a shortcut in Visual Studio for pasting from StackOverflow automatically.</p>
<p>Well, I had a train journey today, and while I don&#39;t have Windows, and therefore don&#39;t have Visual Studio (and thanks heavens, because writing plug-ins for it is worse than hot needles in the eye), but I do have Github and JavaScript so witness the birth of ctrl-rob!</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s even easier than ever to search for your answers on Google and paste code off the internet with <em>absolutely no context whatsoever</em>, satisfaction guaranteed 100%.</p>
<p>It works about as well as you&#39;d expect, that is to say, leveraging the search functionality on Stackoverflow.com isn&#39;t as good as using Google (sad face), if anybody wants to change it so it does that, send me a pull request.</p>
