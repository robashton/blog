I was in a bar last night and one of my ex-colleagues openly admitted that his job is pretty much just copying code from Stackoverflow into Visual Studio.

I jokingly suggested that he could probably automate that and spend the rest of his day looking at pictures of cats on Reddit, and thus the idea of a "ctrl-rob" key was born, a shortcut in Visual Studio for pasting from StackOverflow automatically.

Well, I had a train journey today, and while I don't have Windows, and therefore don't have Visual Studio (and thanks heavens, because writing plug-ins for it is worse than hot needles in the eye), but I do have Github and JavaScript so witness the birth of ctrl-rob!

Now it's even easier than ever to search for your answers on Google and paste code off the internet with *absolutely no context whatsoever*, satisfaction guaranteed 100%.

It works about as well as you'd expect, that is to say, leveraging the search functionality on Stackoverflow.com isn't as good as using Google (sad face), if anybody wants to change it so it does that, send me a pull request.
