<p>So, we can mark indexes as idle, we can automatically do this to auto indexes, and we delete auto indexes that aren&#39;t being used enough - that paves the way for a pretty useful feature - merging automatic indexes for fun and for profit.</p>
<p>What is that you ask? Well - when we do the following series of queries</p>
<pre><code>session.Query&lt;Pony&gt;<span class="hljs-literal">()</span>
    .<span class="hljs-constructor">Where(<span class="hljs-params">pony</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-params">pony</span>.Name <span class="hljs-operator">==</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Rainbow Dash"</span>)</span>
    .<span class="hljs-constructor">FirstOrDefault()</span></code></pre><p>and</p>
<pre><code>session.Query&lt;Pony&gt;<span class="hljs-literal">()</span>
        .<span class="hljs-constructor">Where(<span class="hljs-params">pony</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-params">pony</span>.Colour <span class="hljs-operator">==</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Pink"</span>)</span>
        .<span class="hljs-constructor">ToList()</span></code></pre><p>We will end up with the following indexes in RavenDB</p>
<p><em>Pony/Name</em></p>
<pre><code>    <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> pony <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> ponies
      <span class="hljs-keyword">select</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">new</span> {
          pony.Name
      }</code></pre><p><em>Pony/Colour</em></p>
<pre><code>    <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> pony <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> ponies
      <span class="hljs-keyword">select</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> {
          pony.Colour
      }</code></pre><p>Well, in reality there is no real reason why we&#39;d have two indexes and incur the cost of iterating over documents every time they&#39;re added more often than we need.</p>
<p>One of the things that the query optimiser already does, is look for the &#39;widest&#39; index - that is the index that touches the most fields.</p>
<p>It makes sense therefore, that rather than simply look for the widest index that matches the query, we should look for the most compatible index and create a new one based off of that if it doesn&#39;t match completely.</p>
<p>Consider the above, we should end up with two indexes</p>
<pre><code>    <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> pony <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> ponies
      <span class="hljs-keyword">select</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">new</span> {
          pony.Name
      }</code></pre><p>and</p>
<pre><code>    <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> pony <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> ponies
      <span class="hljs-keyword">select</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">new</span> {
          pony.Name,
          pony.Colour
      }</code></pre><p>Over time, the first index won&#39;t be used (as it&#39;s not as wide as the second index), and it will wither and die because of idling and auto-removal.</p>
<p>Over time, we&#39;ll actually end up with only one index per document type (providing there aren&#39;t any reasons why a query isn&#39;t compatible with an existing index, such as different indexing or sorting options)</p>
<p>This ensures that over time when using automatically generated queries, that RavenDB keeps itself as lean as possible and using as few resources as possible (and tidy!)</p>
<p>Now that covers what I did on in first couple of days at Hibernating Rhinos, next up I&#39;ll talk about what I&#39;m helping do with result transformations.</p>
