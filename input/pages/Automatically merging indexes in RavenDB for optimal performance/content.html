<p>So, we can mark indexes as idle, we can automatically do this to auto indexes, and we delete auto indexes that aren't being used enough - that paves the way for a pretty useful feature - merging automatic indexes for fun and for profit.</p>

<p>What is that you ask? Well - when we do the following series of queries</p>

<pre><code>session.Query&lt;Pony&gt;()
    .Where(pony =&gt; pony.Name == "Rainbow Dash")
    .FirstOrDefault()
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>session.Query&lt;Pony&gt;()
        .Where(pony =&gt; pony.Colour == "Pink")
        .ToList()
</code></pre>

<p>We will end up with the following indexes in RavenDB</p>

<p><em>Pony/Name</em></p>

<pre><code>    from pony in ponies
      select new {
        pony.Name
      }
</code></pre>

<p><em>Pony/Colour</em></p>

<pre><code>    from pony in ponies
      select new {
        pony.Colour
      }
</code></pre>

<p>Well, in reality there is no real reason why we'd have two indexes and incur the cost of iterating over documents every time they're added more often than we need.</p>

<p>One of the things that the query optimiser already does, is look for the 'widest' index - that is the index that touches the most fields.</p>

<p>It makes sense therefore, that rather than simply look for the widest index that matches the query, we should look for the most compatible index and create a new one based off of that if it doesn't match completely.</p>

<p>Consider the above, we should end up with two indexes</p>

<pre><code>    from pony in ponies
      select new {
        pony.Name
      }
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>    from pony in ponies
      select new {
        pony.Name,
        pony.Colour
      }
</code></pre>

<p>Over time, the first index won't be used (as it's not as wide as the second index), and it will wither and die because of idling and auto-removal.</p>

<p>Over time, we'll actually end up with only one index per document type (providing there aren't any reasons why a query isn't compatible with an existing index, such as different indexing or sorting options)</p>

<p>This ensures that over time when using automatically generated queries, that RavenDB keeps itself as lean as possible and using as few resources as possible (and tidy!)</p>

<p>Now that covers what I did on in first couple of days at Hibernating Rhinos, next up I'll talk about what I'm helping do with result transformations.</p>
