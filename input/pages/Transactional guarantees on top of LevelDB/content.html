<p>So, I&#39;m <a href="/entries/basic-operations-with-leveldb.html">experimenting with LevelDB</a> and I&#39;ve discovered that it does atomic writes both on single operations and batches of operations.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t actually all we need in RavenDB, as we need to be able to support multiple reads and writes - potentially over a period of time.</p>
<p>We can&#39;t just be reading from a database that might be changing under our feet all of the time, and it turns out that LevelDB gives us the ability to read from a particular version of the database.</p>
<p>When beginning a long running operation that needs a consistent read-state, we can create a snapshot and use this in all of our reads to ensure we have a consistent view of the database.</p>
<pre><code>// <span class="hljs-keyword">Create</span> a <span class="hljs-keyword">snapshot</span> at the beginning <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> a <span class="hljs-keyword">sequence</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> operations
leveldb::<span class="hljs-keyword">Snapshot</span>* <span class="hljs-keyword">snapshot</span> = db-&gt;GetSnapshot();


// <span class="hljs-keyword">For</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">each</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">read</span> operation we can use this <span class="hljs-keyword">snapshot</span>
leveldb::ReadOptions <span class="hljs-keyword">options</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">options</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">snapshot</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">snapshot</span>;

db-&gt;<span class="hljs-keyword">Get</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">options</span>, &quot;key&quot;, &amp;document);</code></pre><p>That solves that problem then, although it leaves another question in the air - which is how LevelDB handles multiple writers modifying the same key.</p>
<p>Consider a thread coming along and beginning an operation</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attr">tx1</span> = store-&gt;BeginOperation()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span></code></pre><p>And another thread beginning an operation</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attr">tx2</span> = store-&gt;BeginOperation()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span></code></pre><p>And then</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-comment">// Thread one deletes a key</span>
store-&gt;<span class="hljs-constructor">Delete(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;key1&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-params">tx1</span>)</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">// Thread two Writes to that key</span>
store-&gt;<span class="hljs-constructor">Put(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;key1&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-params">tx2</span>)</span>;</code></pre><p>By default (at least as I understand) LevelDB will happily accept these operations as it doesn&#39;t have any concurrency control.</p>
<p>Happily, this is easy enough to work through as we&#39;ll see in the next entry.</p>
