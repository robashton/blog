<p>Putting my keyboard where my... er keyboard is, I&#39;m going to build an application until I get bored and I&#39;m going to do it on top of the ASP.NET MVC stack using my common patterns and <a href="/entries/uncle-bobs-viewpoint-considered-harmful.html">personal brand of pragmatism</a>.</p>
<p>Why ASP.NET MVC? Because like it or lump it, it&#39;s what most companies expect you to be building .NET web apps with if you&#39;re in that space, and while it might be annoying to a small subset of people because using it is like forced to undergo death by a thousand cuts, it is possible to build things in it if you leave your opinions at the door, as seen in my week <a href="/entries/this-week,-lets-create-a-start-up---day-5.html">helping Sam build his start-up with it.</a>.</p>
<p>I was asked on Twitter by a few people what the compromises I felt I had made were, and I found it hard to articulate after the fact, I&#39;m hoping by doing this I can document them as I go and and get feedback on my style as we do this.</p>
<h2>So, the domain</h2>
<p>I want to build a web app which allows small hotel owners to define their hotel, define what they have available, and then embed a booking form into their static website so that they don&#39;t have to be on the phone all the time or miss out of bookings.</p>
<p>I could do this commercially, but a) It has been done before b) There isn&#39;t a huge return on this sort of thing for the effort, so I may as well do it open source.</p>
<h2>The technology</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll be using RavenDB for persistence, and Zombify for my functional testing (I&#39;ll cover the reasons for these choices in the next couple of blog entries)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made those decisions up front because this is the kind of project where I feel I can do that, it&#39;s going to be a rapid development project where I try to put the thing together quickly, and outline what I feel to be steps I&#39;ve skipped in order to go faster and what their repercussions will be.</p>
