<p>What about when we really want to use something like Knockout in our application...</p>
<p>In actual fact, the issue I was being specifically asked to address at this client was that they had chosen to use Knockout on their projects and were generally being quite successful with it until they ran into a situation where getting it to fit was causing issues.</p>
<p><em>How can we build an application which uses Knockout except when it doesn&#39;t</em></p>
<p>A slightly different question and on the surface really obvious but the temptation is there to treat KO as a framework rather than a library and let it rule our application.</p>
<p><em>The difference between a framework and a library is that you use a library, whereas a framework uses you</em></p>
<p>So okay then, let&#39;s pull in Knockout</p>
<pre><code><span class="comment">npm</span> <span class="comment">install</span> <span class="comment">knockout</span> <span class="literal">-</span><span class="literal">-</span><span class="comment">save</code></pre>
<p><em>gasp</em>, yes indeed - it is shipped as a self-contained NPM module which is pretty pleasing if you&#39;re wanting to develop applications in this way.</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> ko = <span class="keyword">require</span>(<span class="string">'ko'</span>)</code></pre>
<p>Being that we only had a couple of hours to complete this programming exercise we needed something simple to apply this to and went for the overly simplistic example of &quot;binding to a select list&quot;. This is a bit unrealistic and I apologise for this - binding to the events of a single element isn&#39;t really the best excuse for importing a large library like KO into your application, <em>obviously</em>.</p>
