</ul>
<p>I guess the first thing we need to do is get some sort of environment up and running on my machine - seeing as this is a <a href="https://github.com/purerl/purescript">fork of Purescript</a> with an Erlang backend and it&#39;s reasonably likely at some point I&#39;m going to have to make a pull request or two, I settled with cloning the repo and running </p>
<pre><code><span class="title">stack</span> build 
<span class="title">stack</span> install</code></pre><p>Haven&#39;t got stack? Well this isn&#39;t a tutorial, so you can Google that if you need to.</p>
<p>I then did the same for <a href="https://github.com/purescript/psc-package">psc-package</a> simply because I couldn&#39;t be bothered working out a different way, if it ain&#39;t broke then don&#39;t fix it - that&#39;s what I always say, my definition of broke is probably more lax than others though so YMMV.</p>
<p>Armed with a purescript compiler and a package manager, the next step is to obviously get something building.</p>
<p>I decided to base my meanderings off of <a href="https://github.com/purerl/purerl_otp_sandbox">pureerl_otp_sandbox</a> at least as far as basic structure goes, although I did modify the makefile a tad so it looks a bit like this (I&#39;m sure it&#39;s changed by the time anybody will read this, but close enough)</p>
<pre><code>.PHONY: all clean

PS_SRC = ps_src
COMPILED_PS = src/compiled_ps
OUTPUT = output

all: <span class="variable">$(</span>COMPILED_PS)

<span class="variable">$(</span>COMPILED_PS): output
    <span class="keyword">mkdir</span> -p <span class="variable">$(</span>COMPILED_PS)
    cp -pu <span class="variable">$(</span>OUTPUT)/<span class="variable">*/</span><span class="variable">*.</span>erl <span class="variable">$(</span>COMPILED_PS)/

clean:
    rm -rf <span class="variable">$(</span>OUTPUT)/*
    rm -f <span class="variable">$(</span>COMPILED_PS)/*</code></pre><p>This is added to a hook in the rebar.config so it happens automatically on rebar3 compile</p>
<pre><code><span class="cell">{pre_hooks,
  [
   {"(linux|darwin|solaris|win32)", compile, "make"}</span>,
   <span class="cell">{"(linux|darwin|solaris|win32)", clean, "clean"}</span>
  ]}.</code></pre><p>Essentially, I can write an Erlang app as if ever ordinarily did, and as long as I have some .purs files in a folder called &quot;ps_src&quot; they&#39;ll get compiled into beam and everything will &quot;just work&quot;.</p>
<p>My psc-package.json is about as stock as it gets at this point and just contains a pile of packages from the <a href="https://github.com/purerl/package-sets">pureerl package set</a>.</p>
<pre><code>{
