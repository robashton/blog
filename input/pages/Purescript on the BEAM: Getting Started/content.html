</ul>
<p>I guess the first thing we need to do is get some sort of environment up and running on my machine - seeing as this is a <a href="https://github.com/purerl/purescript">fork of Purescript</a> with an Erlang backend and it&#39;s reasonably likely at some point I&#39;m going to have to make a pull request or two, I settled with cloning the repo and running </p>
<pre><code>stack build 
stack install</code></pre><p>Haven&#39;t got stack? Well this isn&#39;t a tutorial, so you can Google that if you need to.</p>
<p>I then did the same for <a href="https://github.com/purescript/psc-package">psc-package</a> simply because I couldn&#39;t be bothered working out a different way, if it ain&#39;t broke then don&#39;t fix it - that&#39;s what I always say, my definition of broke is probably more lax than others though so YMMV.</p>
<p>Armed with a purescript compiler and a package manager, the next step is to obviously get something building.</p>
<p>I decided to base my meanderings off of <a href="https://github.com/purerl/purerl_otp_sandbox">pureerl_otp_sandbox</a> at least as far as basic structure goes, although I did modify the makefile a tad so it looks a bit like this (I&#39;m sure it&#39;s changed by the time anybody will read this, but close enough)</p>

<pre><code>{pre_hooks,
  [
   {<span class="hljs-string">&quot;(linux|darwin|solaris|win32)&quot;</span>, compile, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;make&quot;</span>},
   {<span class="hljs-string">&quot;(linux|darwin|solaris|win32)&quot;</span>, clean, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;clean&quot;</span>}
  ]}.</code></pre><p>Essentially, I can write an Erlang app as if ever ordinarily did, and as long as I have some .purs files in a folder called &quot;ps_src&quot; they&#39;ll get compiled into beam and everything will &quot;just work&quot;.</p>
<p>My psc-package.json is about as stock as it gets at this point and just contains a pile of packages from the <a href="https://github.com/purerl/package-sets">pureerl package set</a>.</p>

}</code></pre><p>This is probably already too long for most people to read when sat on the loo, so I&#39;ll leave the writing of any code at all to the next entry..</p>
