<p>So, in <a href="/entries/investigating-ravendb-on-mono-for-reals.html">trying out LevelDB</a>, I need to work out the basics, and then apply those learnings to whether the functionality exposed is compatible with RavenDB&#39;s storage needs.</p>
<p>I spent a few hours in the car on the way to and back from the Dead Sea and this seemed like an ideal time to crack out the g++ and write some C++ on top of LevelDB.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was download <a href="https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/">the source</a> and un-pack it, I also grabbed <a href="http://twitter.com/kellabyte">@kellabytes</a>&#39;s &#39;<a href="https://github.com/kellabyte/Dazzle">Dazzle</a>&#39; source code as an &#39;RTFM&#39; back-up.</p>
<p>What I really like is that the header files for LevelDB are the best means of documentation, I forgot I liked this about C++, I now remember - all the learnings done ended up being done by just reading the source code, pretty neat.</p>
<p>So, what do we have?</p>
<p><em>Opening a database</em></p>
<pre><code>leveldb::<span class="hljs-keyword">DB</span>* <span class="hljs-keyword">db</span>;
leveldb::<span class="hljs-keyword">DB</span>::<span class="hljs-keyword">Open</span>(options, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;play/testdb&quot;</span>, &amp;<span class="hljs-keyword">db</span>);</code></pre><p><em>Putting something in</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attr">status</span> = db-&gt;Put(leveldb::WriteOptions(), <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Key&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Hello World&quot;</span>)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span></code></pre><p><em>Getting something out</em></p>
<pre><code>std::string document;
store-&gt;<span class="hljs-built_in">Get</span>(leveldb::<span class="hljs-built_in">ReadOptions</span>(), <span class="hljs-string">&quot;key&quot;</span>, &amp;document);</code></pre><p><em>Deleting something</em></p>
<pre><code>store-&gt;Delete(<span class="hljs-name">leveldb</span>:<span class="hljs-symbol">:WriteOptions</span>(), <span class="hljs-string">&quot;key&quot;</span>)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span></code></pre><p><em>Squeeeeeeee</em></p>
<p>I love how simple that is, and that each of these is a safe operation, important to note the following at this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m passing in strings to those put/get operations</li>
<li>LevelDB is copying to/from those strings</li>
<li>Because we&#39;re using strings, scope determines the release of memory</li>
</ul>
<p>This is elegant, Put actually takes a &quot;Slice&quot; type too, but that&#39;s implicitly convertable from a string and therefore this works nicely. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll cover Slice on its own as it&#39;s an interesting notion if I understand it correctly.</p>
<p>Importantly for RavenDB, we need to be able to write multiple operations in an atomic fashion, LevelDB appears to accommodate for this neatly.</p>
<pre><code> leveldb::WriteBatch batch;
 batch.<span class="hljs-constructor">Delete(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;key&quot;</span>)</span>;
 batch.<span class="hljs-constructor">Put(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;key2&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-params">value</span>)</span>;
 db-&gt;<span class="hljs-constructor">Write(<span class="hljs-params">leveldb</span>::WriteOptions()</span>, &amp;batch);</code></pre><p>LevelDB can actually operate in async or synchronous mode, but because Raven makes gaurantees about writes having happened I can&#39;t think we&#39;d be able to use async mode (because there isn&#39;t any way to know when these writes are finished to my knowledge).</p>
<p>These guarantees aren&#39;t actually enough for RavenDB, and I&#39;ll cover the reasons for that in the next entry.</p>
