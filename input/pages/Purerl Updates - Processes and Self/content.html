<p>It has been about three years since I first sat in a hotel in Lithuania throwing together the first versions of <a href="https://github.com/id3as/purescript-erl-pinto">purescript-erl-pinto</a> and <a href="https://github.com/id3as/purescript-erl-stetson">purescript-erl-stetson</a> so that we could get started on a project for one of our clients.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of code has been written against those projects internally by colleagues and myself and over time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various improvements/patterns have been discovered within core libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/purerl/purescript-erl-process">purescript-erl-process</a>. </li>
<li>A heap of Erlang specific packages have been written and released</li>
<li>Another mountain of packages have been ported across from Purescript </li>
<li>Pinto and Stetson have been upgraded repeatedly by various colleagues as our understanding of what we need them to do has evolved.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://purerl-cookbook.readthedocs.io/">purerl cookbook</a> has been updated for these latest releases, as has the <a href="https://github.com/id3as/demo-ps">demo-ps</a> but felt it worthwhile highlighting some of the changes in a few (of my increasingly rare) blog posts.</p>
<p>In this post we&#39;ll be looking at Processes and the concept of &#39;self&#39;</p>
<h1 id="processes">Processes</h1>
<p>A common practise in Erlang codebases is to spawn a new process and use its Pid for communication.</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">example</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> -&gt;</span>
  Pid = spawn_link(fun receive_message/0)
  Pid ! hi.

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">receive_message</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> -&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">receive</span>
    SomeMessage -&gt; 
      ?PRINT(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Got a message&quot;</span>),
      ok
   <span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>.</code></pre>
<p>In Purerl, the type <em>Pid</em> lives in <em>Erl.Process.Raw</em> and is just an imported foreign type</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-keyword">foreign</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> data <span class="hljs-type">Pid</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">Type</span></code></pre>
<p>This typically isn&#39;t used to any great amount except in some specific FFI cases, it being far better generally to use the types found in <em>Erl.Process</em> which have the phantom type <em>msg</em> floating around meaning all the sends and receives are limited to the types of message that that process has declared it will receive. <em>Process msg</em> itself is just a newtype around Raw.Pid of course.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">newtype</span> <span class="hljs-type">Process</span> (<span class="hljs-title">a</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">Type</span>)</span>
  = <span class="hljs-type">Process</span> <span class="hljs-type">Raw</span>.<span class="hljs-type">Pid</span></code></pre>
<p>To create a typed process, one could call <em>spawnLink</em> and provide a callback which will be executed in the process created in that underlying call to <em>spawn_link</em> in Erlang. A change made fairly early on in development was to change this callback from something that took some context, to something that operated inside <em>ProcessM msg r</em>, with the context being provided by that monad - this will become important later on in this blog entry so I&#39;ll demonstrate this here.</p>
<h2 id="the-old-way">The old way</h2>
<p>&quot;Given a callback that accepts a <em>SpawnLinkContext</em> typed around <em>msg</em>, run that callback inside a new process and return that new process, also typed around <em>msg</em>&quot;</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">spawnLink</span> :: <span class="hljs-keyword">forall</span> msg. (<span class="hljs-type">SpawnLinkContext</span> msg -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Effect</span> <span class="hljs-type">Unit</span>) -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Effect</span> (<span class="hljs-type">Process</span> msg)</code></pre>
<p>That context then provided the means of receiving messages, being defined as something like</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-type">SpawnLinkContext</span> msg = </span>
  { receive :: <span class="hljs-type">Effect</span> msg 
  , receiveWithTimeout :: <span class="hljs-type">Timeout</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Effect</span> (<span class="hljs-type">Maybe</span> msg)
  }</code></pre>
<p>Thus, the Erlang example, re-written in Purerl would have looked something like this</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">example</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">Effect</span> <span class="hljs-type">Unit</span>
<span class="hljs-title">example</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
  pid &lt;- spawnLink receiveMessage
  pid ! <span class="hljs-string">&quot;hi&quot;</span>

<span class="hljs-title">receiveMessage</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">SpawnLinkContext</span> <span class="hljs-type">String</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Effect</span> <span class="hljs-type">Unit</span>
<span class="hljs-title">receiveMessage</span> c = <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> 
  msg &lt;- c.receive
  log <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Got a message&quot;</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="the-new-way">The new way</h2>
<p>&quot;Evaluate the given code in the context of a <em>ProcessM</em> typed around <em>msg</em>&quot;</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">spawnLink</span> :: <span class="hljs-keyword">forall</span> msg. <span class="hljs-type">ProcessM</span> msg <span class="hljs-type">Unit</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Effect</span> (<span class="hljs-type">Process</span> msg)</code></pre>
<p>And quite simply, any calls to receive/etc are defined as functions that operate inside ProcessM, again all typed around <em>msg</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">receive</span> :: <span class="hljs-keyword">forall</span> msg. <span class="hljs-type">ProcessM</span> msg msg
<span class="hljs-title">receive</span> = <span class="hljs-type">ProcessM</span> <span class="hljs-type">Raw</span>.receive</code></pre>
<p>This cuts down on the cruft somewhat, as instead of having to pass a context everywhere, one can simply write functions in the context of ProcessM, re-writing that initial example now looks like this (Note that the log call needs lifting into <em>ProcessM</em> because it is written as an <em>Effect</em>)</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">example</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">Effect</span> <span class="hljs-type">Unit</span>
<span class="hljs-title">example</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
  pid &lt;- spawnLink receiveMessage
  pid ! <span class="hljs-string">&quot;hi&quot;</span>

<span class="hljs-title">receiveMessage</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">ProcessM</span> <span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-type">Unit</span>
<span class="hljs-title">receiveMessage</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> 
  msg &lt;- receive
  liftEffect $ log <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Got a message&quot;</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="extending-this-model">Extending this model</h2>
<p>It turns out that this is quite a nice pattern for representing the different <em>types</em> of process available in Erlang (OTP, Cowboy and indeed our own application code), consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cowboy Loop handlers</li>
<li>Cowboy Websocket handlers</li>
<li>OTP gen_server</li>
<li>OTP supervisor</li>
<li>OTP gen_statem</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these could be ran as <em>ProcessM</em>, except they have more types associated with them <em>and</em> various functions available designed for use in those specific contexts, for example in the simple case of cowboy..</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-type">WebSocketInfoHandler</span> msg state</span>
  = msg -&gt; state -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">WebSocketResult</span> msg (<span class="hljs-type">WebSocketCallResult</span> state)</code></pre>
<p>We have the types <em>msg</em> and <em>state</em> in our type because the callbacks involved tend to take <em>state</em> and there is a callback (<em>info</em>) for messages received by the loop handler typed around <em>msg</em></p>
<p>In the more complicated case of an OTP GenServer, this looks like this</p>
<pre><code>type C<span class="hljs-literal">all</span>Fn reply cont stop msg <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>
  = From reply -&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> -&gt; ResultT cont stop msg <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> (C<span class="hljs-literal">all</span>Result reply cont stop <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>)</code></pre><p>Most operations take place inside that <em>ResultT</em> which encodes the <em>cont</em>, <em>stop</em>, <em>msg</em>, and <em>state</em> types for use with our operations. (<em>cont</em> being the message that can be received by <em>handle_continue</em>, <em>stop</em> being a custom stop reason, <em>msg</em> being messages received by <em>handle_info</em> and <em>state</em> being the state of the gen server).</p>
<p>We also end up with our own contexts in our own codebases for specific process types around common units of business logic. </p>
<h2 id="common-functionality">Common Functionality</h2>
<p>In most of these cases, just like with <em>Process.spawnLink</em>, something gets returned that represents the started process - for example the GenServer.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">startLink</span> :: <span class="hljs-keyword">forall</span> cont stop msg state. 
  (<span class="hljs-type">ServerSpec</span> cont stop msg state) 
  -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Effect</span> (<span class="hljs-type">StartLinkResult</span> (<span class="hljs-type">ServerPid</span> cont stop msg state))</code></pre>
<p>Here we have a <em>ServerPid cont stop msg state</em> returned to the caller - again keeping a lot of useful information around to help us make calls into a GenServer but the type we&#39;re interested in here is <em>msg</em>. Most generic APIs will be written around the concept of a <em>Process msg</em> and what we have here is a <em>ServerPid cont stop msg state</em></p>
<p>The logical step here is to expose</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">toProcess</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">ServerPid</span> cont stop msg state -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Process</span> msg</code></pre>
<p>It turns out that this is a very common operation and so a typeclass is born and added to Erl.Process for everybody to implement when writing this kind of code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-type">HasProcess</span> b a <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span></span>
  getProcess :: a -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Process</span> b</code></pre>
<p>In fact, two typeclasses are born because some APIs only need a Pid after all.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-type">HasPid</span> a <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span></span>
  getPid :: a -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Pid</span></code></pre>
<p>Most functions that take a <em>Process msg</em> therefore don&#39;t actually care about it <em>being</em> a <em>Process msg</em>, but only that a <em>Process msg</em> can be gotten from the type</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-title">callMe</span> :: <span class="hljs-keyword">forall</span> p msg. 
  <span class="hljs-type">HasProcess</span> msg p =&gt; 
  p -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Effect</span> <span class="hljs-type">Unit</span></code></pre>
<p>And now all of those custom types can be used with a whole suite of APIs without having to unpack a convoluted structure of newtypes.</p>
<h2 id="self">Self</h2>
<p>There is one more common operation that has been ignored so far, and that is the concept of self. An incredibly common thing in Erlang is to invoke <em>self</em> to get the Pid of the current process.</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">Self = self(),
some_api:call_me(Self)</code></pre>
<p>For a while, we started having <em>self</em> methods on every module that exported some monad in which process logic could be evalulated, and this would return the full type of the process (complete with <em>cont</em>, <em>stop</em>, <em>state</em>, etc). There were a lot of <em>self</em> functions being exported and imported and in 99.99% of all cases they were immediately followed by a call to <em>getProcess</em> using the <em>HasProcess</em> typeclass implementation for that system.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">(me :: <span class="hljs-type">Process</span> <span class="hljs-type">MyMsg</span>) &lt;- getProcess &lt;$&gt; <span class="hljs-type">GenServer</span>.self</code></pre>
<p>What does <em>self</em> mean then? The correct answer is as written above, but the correct answer isn&#39;t always the nicest answer - it was very rare that we would need anything from <em>self</em> other than the current <em>Process msg</em> and we were running into issues in modules that had code for more than one of these contexts in them, whose self are we using anyway?</p>
<p>The answer was to be pragmatic and create a typeclass for &#39;<em>any m</em>&#39; that allowed that &#39;<em>m</em>&#39; to export a <em>Process msg</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-type">HasSelf</span> (<span class="hljs-title">m</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">Type</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Type</span>) msg | m -&gt; msg <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span></span>
  self :: m (<span class="hljs-type">Process</span> msg)</code></pre>
<p>For the case of anything running inside a <em>ProcessM</em>, this isn&#39;t any more complicated than calling Raw.self to get the current pid and wrapping it up with the relevant newtypes</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">instance</span> selfProcessM :: <span class="hljs-type">HasSelf</span> (<span class="hljs-type">ProcessM</span> <span class="hljs-title">a</span>) a <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span></span>
  self :: <span class="hljs-keyword">forall</span> a. <span class="hljs-type">ProcessM</span> a (<span class="hljs-type">Process</span> a)
  self = <span class="hljs-type">ProcessM</span> $ <span class="hljs-type">Process</span> &lt;$&gt; <span class="hljs-type">Raw</span>.self</code></pre>
<p>Similar implementations then exist for Pinto/Stetson contexts, allowing code to simply call <em>Process.self</em> from practically anywhere to get a typed <em>Process msg</em> valid for the current context.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell"><span class="hljs-type">SomeApi</span>.callMe &lt;&lt;&lt; self</code></pre>
<p>All typed, all safe, nobody sent messages they can&#39;t handle - living the dream.</p>
