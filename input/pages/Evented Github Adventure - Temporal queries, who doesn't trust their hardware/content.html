<li>Temporal queries in the event store</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing <a href="/entries/evented-github-adventure---who-writes-the-sweariest-commit-messages.html">basic aggregations</a> is fairly easy, but actually one of the great selling points of the projections system inside the EventStore is how easy it is to do temporal queries.</p>
<p>What is a temporal query? Well the example that <a href="http://twitter.com/gregyoung">Greg Young</a> always uses is &quot;look for all the events in Twitter where somebody mentions starbucks, coffee, and happy within five minutes of each other&quot;</p>
<p>The clue there is &quot;look for all the events&quot;, and we&#39;ll see why that is with this example.</p>
<p><strong>Git</strong></p>
<p>Git is great, it&#39;s great because it&#39;s a DCVS and we can do everything locally and push to a remote repo when we feel we&#39;re ready.</p>
<p>That said, some people don&#39;t do this, every commit is a push - maybe it&#39;s because they&#39;re not used to using a system where they can work offline, or maybe they&#39;re just paranoid because they&#39;re working on a laptop they don&#39;t trust.</p>
<p>Either way, this is a great example of a temporal query we could write.</p>
<p><strong>A query on Git</strong></p>
<p>*&quot;Find the instances of pushes within X minutes of each other from the same user and same repo&quot;, is there a trend across different languages for this kind of usage?*</p>
<p>I would <em>not</em> enjoy doing this in a standard database, but that&#39;s neither here nor there, let&#39;s see what we have.</p>
<p>First off, the important question is &quot;what is the unique combination we&#39;re looking for&quot;</p>
<p>We care about <em>PushEvent</em>s for a unique <em>User</em> and <em>Repo</em>, so it makes sense that what we should do is <em>partition by UserAndRepo</em>  so we can easily keep state around per repo.</p>
<p><strong>Partition by uniqueness</strong></p>
<p>Here is how that might look:</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">fromStream</span><span class="params">('github')</span>
  .<span class="title">when</span><span class="params">(<span class="tuple">{
    <span class="string">"PushEvent"</span>: <span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>(state, ev) <span class="tuple">{
      var repo = ev.body.repo.full_name
      <span class="function_name">linkTo</span>('pushesbyrepo-' + repo, ev)
    }</span>
  })</code></pre><p>So far so good, I now have a stream per repo called &quot;pushesbyrepo-{reponame}&quot; - now what?</p>
<p>Well, the key thing I mentioned above was that we&#39;re &quot;looking for all the events where&quot;, this suggests that perhaps the thing we are looking for should be considered an event in its own right.</p>
<p>We can do this, we can for each of thse streams keep a note of when the last push was, and if we encounter another push within a certain time-frame, emit an event for this find of ours.</p>
<p><strong>Running a projection per generated stream</strong></p>
<p>How to run this for each stream? Enter fromCategory</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">fromCategory</span><span class="params">('pushesbyrepo')</span>
  <span class="title">foreachStream</span><span class="params">()</span>
  .<span class="title">when</span><span class="params">(<span class="tuple">{
    $init: // etc
  }</span>)</span></code></pre><p>There is a built in projection in the EventStore that will automatically use the character &#39;-&#39; to sort a collection of streams into categories, and if we have</p>
<ul>
<li>pushesbyrepo-bob</li>
<li>pushesbyrepo-alice</li>
<li>pushesbyrepo-derpy</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#39;ll get three categories to iterate through (bob, alice, and derpy)</p>
<p><strong>Emit the events we&#39;re looking for</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">fromCategory</span><span class="params">('pushesbyrepo')</span>
  <span class="title">foreachStream</span><span class="params">()</span>
  .<span class="title">when</span><span class="params">(<span class="tuple">{
    $init: <span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>(state, ev) <span class="tuple">{
      return <span class="tuple">{}</span>
    }</span>,
    <span class="string">"PushEvent"</span>: <span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>(state, ev) <span class="tuple">{
      if(state.last<span class="variable">Push</span>) <span class="tuple">{
        var new<span class="variable">Date</span> = new <span class="variable">Date</span>(ev.body.created_at)
          , last<span class="variable">Date</span> = new <span class="variable">Date</span>(state.last<span class="variable">Push</span>.body.created_at)
          , difference = (new<span class="variable">Date</span>.<span class="function_name">getTime</span>() - last<span class="variable">Date</span>.<span class="function_name">getTime</span>()) / <span class="number">1000</span>

        if(difference &lt; <span class="number">120</span>) <span class="tuple">{
          <span class="function_name">emit</span>('paranoidpushes', <span class="string">"ParanoidPush"</span>, <span class="tuple">{
            first: state.last<span class="variable">Push</span>,
            next: ev
          }</span>)
        }</span>
      }
      state.last<span class="variable">Push</span> = ev
      return state
    }
  })</code></pre><p>Seems legit, simply keep the last PushEvent around at all times, when we get a new one, check the difference and emit an event if it&#39;s less than X minutes. NICE</p>
<p>Running this, I now have a stream at </p>
<p><em>/streams/paranoidpushes</em> </p>
<p>So, how many paranoid pushes have I had in the time period I&#39;ve been sampling over? (roughly three hours at time of writing)</p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">fromStream</span><span class="params">('paranoidpushes')</span>
  .<span class="title">when</span><span class="params">(<span class="tuple">{
    <span class="string">"$init"</span>: <span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>(state, ev) <span class="tuple">{
      return <span class="tuple">{ count: <span class="number">0</span> }</span>
    }</span>,
    <span class="string">"ParanoidPush"</span>: <span class="keyword">fun</span><span class="function_name">ction</span>(state, ev) <span class="tuple">{
      state.count++
    }</span>
  })</code></pre><p>And the result?</p>
<pre><code><span class="rules">{ <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">count</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">104533</span> }</span></span></span></code></pre><p>Voila, that&#39;s an incredibly simply temporal query that just works and gives me the total number of pushes that happened within 2 minutes of each other to the same repository - and it&#39;s pretty easy too. We have two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push out events for each instance of some temporal correlation</li>
<li>Aggregate on those events to get the result</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have this, perhaps we can look at combining this data we have to work out how this strange use of git plays out across different language developers.</p>
