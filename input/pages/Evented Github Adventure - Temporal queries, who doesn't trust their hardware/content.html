<p>Doing <a href="/entries/evented-github-adventure---who-writes-the-sweariest-commit-messages.html">basic aggregations</a> is fairly easy, but actually one of the great selling points of the projections system inside the EventStore is how easy it is to do temporal queries.</p>

<p>What is a temporal query? Well the example that <a href="http://twitter.com/gregyoung">Greg Young</a> always uses is "look for all the events in Twitter where somebody mentions starbucks, coffee, and happy within five minutes of each other"</p>

<p>The clue there is "look for all the events", and we'll see why that is with this example.</p>

<p><strong>Git</strong></p>

<p>Git is great, it's great because it's a DCVS and we can do everything locally and push to a remote repo when we feel we're ready.</p>

<p>That said, some people don't do this, every commit is a push - maybe it's because they're not used to using a system where they can work offline, or maybe they're just paranoid because they're working on a laptop they don't trust.</p>

<p>Either way, this is a great example of a temporal query we could write.</p>

<p><strong>A query on Git</strong></p>

<p><em>"Find the instances of pushes within X minutes of each other from the same user and same repo", is there a trend across different languages for this kind of usage?</em></p>

<p>I would <em>not</em> enjoy doing this in a standard database, but that's neither here nor there, let's see what we have.</p>

<p>First off, the important question is "what is the unique combination we're looking for"</p>

<p>We care about <em>PushEvent</em>s for a unique <em>User</em> and <em>Repo</em>, so it makes sense that what we should do is <em>partition by UserAndRepo</em> and then look at the PushEvents as they happen.</p>

<p><strong>Partition by uniqueness</strong></p>

<p>Here is how that might look:</p>

<pre><code>fromStream('github')
  .partitionBy(function(ev) {
    if(ev.body.repo) {
      return ev.body.repo.fullname
    }
  })
  .when({
    $init: function(state, ev) {

    },
    "PushEvent": function(state, ev) {

    }
  })
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good, we have per repo a unique projection being run, now all we need to do is work out what kind of state we should be building.</p>

<p>Well, the key thing I mentioned above was that we're "looking for all the events where", this suggests that perhaps we should be looking to emit an event for any occurences of what we're looking for (which we can then use to do stats on this info)</p>

<p>How about simply making a note every time we reach a PushEvent, and then if we get another PushEvent, check how long it has been since the last one, and if it was recent - emit an event?</p>

<p><strong>Emit the events</strong></p>

<pre><code>fromStream('github')
  .partitionBy(function(ev) {
    if(ev.body.repo) {
      return ev.body.repo.fullname
    }
  })
  .when({
    $init: function(state, ev) {
      state.lastPush = null
    },
    "PushEvent": function(state, ev) {
      if(state.lastPush) {
        var newDate = new Date(ev.body.created_at)
          , lastDate = new Date(state.lastPush.body.created_at)
          , difference = (newDate.getTime() - lastDate.getTime()) / 1000

        if(difference &lt; 120) {
          emit('github-paranoidpushes', "ParanoidPush", {
            first: state.lastPush,
            next: ev
          })
        }
      }
      state.lastPush = ev
    }
  })
</code></pre>

<p>Seems legit, simply keep the last PushEvent around at all times, when we get a new one, check the difference and emit an event if it's less than X minutes. NICE</p>

<p>Running this, I now have a stream at </p>

<p><em>/streams/github-paranoidpushes</em> </p>

<p>So, how many paranoid pushes have I had in the time period I've been sampling over? (roughly three hours at time of writing)</p>

<pre><code>fromStream('github-paranoidpushes')
  .when({
    "$init": function(state, ev) {
      state.count = 0
    },
    "ParanoidPush": function(state, ev) {
      state.count++
    }
  })
</code></pre>

<p>And the result?</p>

<pre><code>{ count: 1504 }
</code></pre>

<p>Voila, that's a temporal query that just works - and it's pretty easy too. Now we have this, perhaps we can look at combining this data we have to work out how paranoia works out across different language developers...</p>
