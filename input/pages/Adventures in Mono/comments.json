Have you looked at using OpenSUSE from Novell?  It will provide you with the Mono environment pre-configured.  I started with that and installed the things I needed from there.  In my case I needed Mongo DB and it was fairly easy.  It seems that Ubuntu takes extra steps, and hence your post.\r\n\t\t\t\t"},{"author":{"name":"robashton","avatar":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b6a6693f03003f7ab0f9b0882e9c2dde&size=50&default=identicon"},"date":"(12/13/2010 6:12 PM)","text":"\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUbuntu comes with a Mono environment pre-configured, it just wasn't bleeding edge like the one I wanted!\r\n\t\t\t\t"}]
