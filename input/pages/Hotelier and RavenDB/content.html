<p>I&#39;m building a hotel booking system aimed towards small hotel/bnb owners who have static websites and want to embed a booking system onto those pages.</p>
<p>I made the assertion I was going to use RavenDB, this is why:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a sample project written using RavenDB a couple of years ago, it&#39;s out dated, I want to bring it forwards</li>
<li>I haven&#39;t written much about RavenDB since those two years, and people are complaining that the blog entries I wrote are out of date</li>
<li>RavenDB is <em>fantastic</em> for this kind of project, I know from experience that it&#39;ll stay out of my way while I put things together</li>
<li>I want to do functional end-to-end testing, but don&#39;t want to write in-memory persistence. RavenDB will do this for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s about it. If you haven&#39;t used RavenDB yet then perhaps this will show you why you might choose to in a project of this nature.</p>
<p>As a reminder, I&#39;m able to with RavenDB create basic POCOs and persist them without worrying about it like so</p>
<p><strong>Persisting a new hotel</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">using</span><span class="params">(var session = store.<span class="variable">OpenSession</span>()</span>) {
  <span class="title">var</span> <span class="title">hotel</span> = <span class="title">new</span> H<span class="title">otel</span><span class="params">(<span class="string">"The waterfall Inn"</span>)</span>;
  <span class="title">session</span>.S<span class="title">tore</span><span class="params">(hotel)</span>;
  <span class="title">session</span>.S<span class="title">aveChanges</span><span class="params">()</span>;
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Loading a hotel, changing something about it</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">using</span><span class="params">(var session = store.<span class="variable">OpenSession</span>()</span>) {
  <span class="title">var</span> <span class="title">hotel</span> = <span class="title">session</span>.L<span class="title">oad</span>&lt;H<span class="title">otel</span>&gt;<span class="params">(id)</span>;
  <span class="title">hotel</span>.A<span class="title">ddRoom</span><span class="params">(new <span class="variable">Room</span>(<span class="number">5</span>)</span>);
  <span class="title">session</span>.S<span class="title">aveChanges</span><span class="params">()</span>;
}</code></pre>
<p>Remember? It has auto change tracking, which means no faffing around remembering to call Save etc</p>
<p><strong>Searching for hotels</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="function"><span class="title">using</span><span class="params">(var session = store.<span class="variable">OpenSession</span>()</span>) {
  <span class="title">var</span> <span class="title">hotels</span> = <span class="title">session</span>.Q<span class="title">uery</span>&lt;H<span class="title">otel</span>&gt;<span class="params">()</span>
                      .W<span class="title">here</span><span class="params">(x=&gt; x.<span class="variable">Name</span> == <span class="string">"Waterfall"</span>)</span>
                      .T<span class="title">oList</span><span class="params">()</span>;

}</code></pre>
<p>Remember? Auto index creation and look-up meas you can very easily do queries etc, kinda neat.</p>
<p><strong>Basically</strong></p>
<p>RavenDB makes life easy and I want to focus a bit more on my method of building this type of application in general so it&#39;s ideal for that :)</p>
