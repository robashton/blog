By the time July rolls around, I will have spent half a year travelling around [working for free](/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html), learning new technologies, picking up new skills and in general becoming a [happier person](/entries/a-note-on-working-hours-and-working-at-home.html).

I can't keep doing this forever, aside from the slow drip of money out of my bank accounts I already miss having a permanent base to go back to.

So, from July I'll need to start earning a regular or semi-regular income once more, and it is therefore time to publicise let the world know I'm ready for it again.

**Who am I?**

I have spent the past decade delivering software primarily in the Microsoft space with a focus on C# and JS. I mostly end up in charge of the software projects I'm involve with and have a focus on keeping the team's options open and able to react to change.

I am a regular on the conference circuit and tend to talk about testing, javascripts and pragmatic development in .NET.

I write code, I write a *lot* of code, I have the ability to learn things *quickly* and start delivering early on after starting a new role and I am an enthusiastic sharer of ideas and opinions.

**What I'm offering**

I am offering my nimble fingers and active mind to anyone in the world, I can...

- Help build features, and teach at the same time
- Run workshops on JS (back-end or front-end), ASP.NET MVC and RavenDB
- Improve your testing strategies
- Help remove obstacles from your development process!
- Help you move forward from your legacy issues (Silverlight to ...?)
- Advise on your long-term architectural problems/goals

I am good at shipping code, I am knowledgable in many areas of .NET development and have spent a lot of time using and developing against alternative databases for the past few years.

**What I looking for**

I am flexible, I ask for you to be the same. I am always happy to travel on-site providing my expenses are covered, but I think I am going to start renting a house again and will probably want to be spending some time there in between trips.

I am most likely looking for short-term consultancy work (4-5 days) and short-term development work (2-8 weeks). 

I am looking for work in any country; as mentioned above I'm happy to travel.

My rates are flexible and tend to vary depending on country, convenience and company. I am looking to sustain a lifestyle and can therefore offer flexibility.

**So**

Do get in touch at [robashton@codeofrob.com](mailto:robashton@codeofrob.com) and ask me for availability from July onwards, I am already starting to fill my calendar with paid work from that date onwards so will likely need advance notice for anything more than a week or so.
