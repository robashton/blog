Would need a technical test before being allowed to make a rating :)\r\n\t\t\t\t"},{"author":{"name":"Alex Brown","avatar":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ccbfb318718602f838caf25020bd4cc8&size=50&default=identicon"},"date":"(1/14/2011 1:18 PM)","text":"\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHave you had the \"I want you to work exclusively with me, so take your CV off linked in, monster etc...\" or I won't send you any of my amazing, exclusive oppourtunities?That one always makes me chuckle.As did \"My client are looking for a SQL 2005/2008 DBA, that works on Linux\"I guess the above was selling me a car or kitchen a couple of weeks prior to that email...\r\n\t\t\t\t"},{"author":{"name":"J","avatar":"/images/IdenticonHandler.ashx?code=209150174"},"date":"(8/1/2011 1:34 PM)","text":"\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYeah - why do so many of them send job titles which are clearly irrelevant when they have only contacted because they saw my CV on their agency db - I know why ;)Sometimes I reply back saying that the one they sent wasn't quite relevant but give them details of my expectations which are high - especially the renumeration!!Never know, I might strike lucky!!\r\n\t\t\t\t"}]
