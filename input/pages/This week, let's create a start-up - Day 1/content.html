<p><strong>This post was written on Monday</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve finished my <a href="/entries/this-week,-lets-create-a-start-up.html">first day</a> of the build a start-up in a week challenge, and now I know a little more about the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam has already built a codebase that his local church uses to put sermons online</li>
<li>His target audience is non-technical churches that have managed to get a website up there (even if it&#39;s just static code)</li>
<li>He wants to be able to embed a single line of code in one of their pages and give them all the functionality</li>
<li>The functionality isn&#39;t too complex, but it has to be dead easy</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so what the heck are sermons and what&#39;s the deal about getting them online</p>
<ul>
<li>Churches have sermons</li>
<li>A sermon is just an audio file (encoded to a variety of formats)</li>
<li>Each sermon can belong to a series of sermons (perhaps on a topic of some sort)</li>
<li>Sermons have meta data associated with them, as do the series</li>
<li>Each church needs their own subset of this data</li>
<li>Each church can have multiple users who can add sermons and series</li>
</ul>
<p>Not that complicated, and my first suggestion is</p>
<p><em>Can&#39;t we just use Wordpress/Drupal/Etc and have this done in a few hours?</em></p>
<p>If I was building an MVP, that&#39;s pretty much what I&#39;d do, but Sam is pretty insistent that he wants it done in .NET (<em>long time no see</em>) and RavenDB (<em>I was doing this last week!</em>), so I guess I need to get out my Windows laptop and once more work my way around the perils of .NET and ASP.NET MVC)</p>
<p>Why ASP.NET MVC? Because I actually remember quite a lot of it from the last time I did .NET and I&#39;m not going to waste time trying to learn another .NET web framework when I have to start building stuff <em>now</em> - when building something with such a short time-frame, you should be using something you know to make the most of the time.</p>
<p>Anyway, after trying to create a few &quot;empty sites&quot; in Visual Studio, I finally find a configuration that is &quot;emptier&quot; than the other ones and get to work (this is still confusing Microsoft!)</p>
<p>Turns out it&#39;s not only &quot;mediocre&quot; these days, but I&#39;m actually able to get most of the basic CRUD operations and workflow done in a few hours, highlights of this experience being:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Razor View Engine</li>
<li>Html.EditorForModel</li>
<li>Html.EditorFor</li>
<li>Data Validation Attributes for the ViewModels (sorry guys, but they work quite well)</li>
<li>Global action filters</li>
</ul>
<p>The default model binding seems to work out of the box for everything, and RavenDB is being managed via global action filters so I only have to do</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">this</span><span class="variable">.Documents</span>()</code></pre><p>In any controller to get the document session (yay for extension methods), no I&#39;m not bothering wiring up a container, the only objects in play are the input/view models and RavenDB and the state model that is being persisted in it, and it&#39;s unlikely to get much more complicated than that (so end-to-end tests will suffice with an in-memory RavenDB for now)</p>
<p>I even wrote a little bit of magic to do paging in a standard way across any view that needs them in RavenDB</p>
<pre><code>pagedResults = session.Query<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">Whatever</span>&gt;</span>()
       .Where(x=&gt; SomeCondition(x))
       .PerformPaging(inputModel)</code></pre><p>Yay again for extension methods.</p>
<p>I also set up OAuth - I used DotNetOpenAuth, which worked once I&#39;d written a pile of code in a controller action - it&#39;s <em>much</em> better than the previous incarnations I used last time I did .NET, but it&#39;s still not quite as good as say, passport in NodeJS (and I&#39;ll hazard a guess it doesn&#39;t quite meet the standards of whatever RoR provides for this either).</p>
<p>I guess that&#39;s because with node, we usually have control over the entry point and everything can be done with connect middleware in a standardised fashion, whereas ASP.NET MVC is an opinionated framework which doesn&#39;t know what its opinions are and still suffers from a sad-mix of xml configuration and confusion, still - I guess once you know about this stuff you can copy and paste these bits of infrastructure around so it&#39;s not too awful.</p>
<p>Anyway, today I achieved with ASP.NET MVC and RavenDB</p>
<ul>
<li>All the basic CRUD forms + workflow around sermons and series (about 10 dynamic pages in all)</li>
<li>Basic paging/filtering controls for anything that needs them</li>
<li>Audio upload (alhough not going to S3 yet)</li>
<li>Authentication with credentials</li>
<li>Authentication via OAuth</li>
<li>Theming using the bootstrap theme Sam has already provided</li>
</ul>
<p>Tomorrow I&#39;ll hook up the script to embed content in third party websites, and get the MVP finished - that&#39;ll leave three days to do all the value-adds, I&#39;m fairly happy with this progress and feel that <em>this</em> is still how we build software, even if it&#39;s not in the technology I&#39;d have chosen.</p>
