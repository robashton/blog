- But what can I blog about?
- I couldn't blog about anything I learn because it's nothing new
- What if people make fun of me?
- I don't have time

Whenever I suggest to somebody that they might want to blog about whatever it is they're learning/doing, these are the responses that I get, and it makes me pretty sad.
