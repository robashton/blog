<h1 id="so-it-s-haskell-">So it&#39;s Haskell?</h1>
<p>Not really, there are a lot of things in common with Haskell but on closer inspection they are typically same-same-but-different.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">    <span class="comment">-- Haskell</span>
    doSomething :: <span class="type">Foo</span> -&gt; <span class="type">Bar</span>

    <span class="comment">-- Elm</span>
    doSomething : <span class="type">Foo</span> -&gt; <span class="type">Bar</span></code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">    <span class="comment">-- Haskell</span>
    doSomething x y = x $ somethingElse y

    <span class="comment">-- Elm</span>
    doSomething x y = x &lt;| somethingElse y</code></pre>
<p>I don&#39;t really care about any of these differences, as they are largely arbitrary syntax/naming decisions - although I do feel as though maintaining more of a similarity with Haskell seeing as these choices <em>are</em> arbitrary would make it easier to port code or read documentation across the two.  (The Elm compiler is hosted in Haskell after all anyway...)</p>
<p>The lack of typeclasses has lead to things like this though</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">

    <span class="comment">-- Haskell</span>
    andFinally &lt;$&gt; somethingElse &lt;$&gt; something

    <span class="comment">-- Elm</span>
    <span class="type">Maybe</span>.andThen (<span class="type">Maybe</span>.andThen something somethingElse) andFinally

</code></pre>
<p>Not to mention the functions that List has that String doesn&#39;t (I don&#39;t care if String is a list or not, a lot of the same operations do apply and having to look up functions for &#39;String&#39; or &#39;List&#39; instead of just functions that apply against monoids - bleh.</p>
<p>Agh.</p>
<h1 id="typeclasses">Typeclasses</h1>
<p>No type classes, there is a whole history of conversation about the lack of need for them (and the ability for ADTs to do the job admirably), I have yet to see this promised land however, all I see is a bunch of modules for different data structures with methods dangling off them and it reminds me a bit of Erlang where my ability to write sensibly composed functional code is often hampered by its fudge of modules.</p>
<p>By getting rid (in name anyway) of Monads, Applicative, etc - Elm seems much more acessible to the average user. That&#39;s not to say that they don&#39;t exist in some form in the codebase but side effects/etc have been shoved into the more domain specific &quot;<a href="https://github.com/elm-lang/core/blob/master/src/Task.elm">Task</a>&quot; and Effect managers and in the Elm Architecture itself it&#39;s rare you have to touch anything that isn&#39;t &quot;just data&quot;. </p>
<p>This is a sensible design decision on the surface, as users who are new to functional programming aren&#39;t overwhelmed by concepts but I can&#39;t help but feel that the data-oriented patterns in Elm couldn&#39;t be exposed in Haskell itself without surfacing those &quot;tricky&quot; concepts whilst keeping them available (there&#39;s a weekend project then). </p>
<p>Moving on, by placing focus on ADTs and records and inferring expected structure from usage the error messages can be a bit perplexing to start off with, despite them being very well written.</p>
<p>Consider this function for example</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">    <span class="typedef"><span class="keyword">type</span> alias <span class="type">Model</span> = <span class="container">{
      <span class="title">realField</span> : <span class="type">String</span>
    }</span></span>

    extractThingy : <span class="type">Model</span> -&gt; <span class="type">String</span>
    extractThingy model = model.missingField
</code></pre>
<p>The error from this both simultaneously very useful and counter-intuitive:</p>
<pre>
    -- TYPE MISMATCH ------------------------------------------------------ Test.elm

    The type annotation for `extractThingy` does not match its definition.

    23| extractThingy : Model -> String
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    The type annotation is saying:

        { realField : ... } -> String

    But I am inferring that the definition has this type:

        { b | missingField : ... } -> a

    Detected errors in 1 module.  
</pre>

<p>Instead of &quot;Hey, Model doesn&#39;t have a field called missingField&quot; we get a complaint that the code is inferring a structure with &#39;missingField&#39; by usage and it doesn&#39;t match the definition it has been supplied. This is because the compiler works backwards from the point of usage and gives its error messages from that context.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the only one who got confused initially by this and with more complicated structures and nested code the errors being dumped out can be pretty daunting. It&#39;s something you get the hang of though and the descriptive nature of the error messages make them look a lot more excessive than they really are.</p>
<h1 id="functional-records">Functional Records</h1>
<p><a href="http://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2015/11/06/functionally-updating-record-types-in-elm/">This has been covered before</a>, but records have &#39;getters&#39; generated for them so we can do things like this</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">    <span class="typedef"><span class="keyword">type</span> alias <span class="type">Model</span> = <span class="container">{ 
          <span class="title">realField</span> : <span class="type">String</span>
        }</span></span>

    extractThingy : <span class="type">List</span> <span class="type">Model</span> -&gt; <span class="type">List</span> <span class="type">String</span>
    extractThingy items = <span class="type">List</span>.map .realField items
</code></pre>
<p>This can be quite handy if we&#39;re writing functional code around records, sadly no equivalent setters are generated so it&#39;s hard to compose operations against records.</p>
<h1 id="development-environment">Development environment</h1>
<p>I&#39;m in Emacs these days on account of our company&#39;s switch to <a href="https://www.rebar3.org/">Rebar3</a> in the <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a> world and my reluctance to sit there and fix my Vim plug-ins; I&#39;m therefore using <a href="https://github.com/jcollard/elm-mode">elm-mode</a> which gives me access to some integration with elm-reactor and elm-format which we use and don&#39;t even bother arguing about.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-style-guide">elm-style guide</a> from No-Red-Ink leaves us one less thing to worry about when writing code.</p>
<p>I currently really miss the following things from my Haskell development:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mew.org/~kazu/proj/ghc-mod/en/">ghc-mod</a></li>
<li><a href="www.haskell.org/hoogle/">hoogle</a></li>
<li>compile-on-save insta-feedback-in-repl</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I can probably do the latter in an hour or so with existing tooling, but right now I feel one of the biggest benefits of having a sensible type system is missing: Being able to inspect the darned types and work out how functions are supposed to compose without having to constantly jump to documentation.</p>
<p>Hoogle or a hoogle-like is a must, even with something as low on surface area as Elm; when you know the types of what you&#39;re working with and you know the types of the things you want then Hoogle is one of the most useful things in your arsenal.</p>
<p>That said, a lot of the time in Haskell we are dealing with parametric types and the functions we are looking for go from (a -&gt; b) -&gt; b, in our record and ADT oriented world we don&#39;t have the interchangeability that we&#39;d get in that world and Hoogle is less useful. I don&#39;t know how I feel about that yet.</p>

<p>I see that the Almighty <a href="http://twitter.com/bodil">@bodil</a> <a href="https://github.com/bodil/purescript-signal">Got there already</a> as I was just musing about using the patterns in Elm in a better programming language, I&#39;d be interested in seeing 0.17 &quot;bye bye FRP&quot; patterns written in Purescript for sure.</p>
<h1 id="next-up-">Next up..</h1>
<p>I&#39;ll look at the structure of our web apps and highlight some of the issues and decisions we&#39;ve encountered so far in 0.17</p>
