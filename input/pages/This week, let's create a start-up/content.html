<p>This week on my grand adventure of <a href="/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html">"building stuff for people"</a>, I am going to help <a href="http://twitter.com/samuel_d_jack">@samuel_d-jack</a> build a start-up.</p>

<p>I'm actually writing this on Monday morning so I'm not yet in the office and don't know what is expected of me, I'll be writing a blog post each day for publishing the next day, so my final write-up will appear on Saturday (ooh, a blog post on Saturday, that'll break the mold)</p>

<p>What I do know</p>

<ul>
<li>Sam occasionally works on RavenDB</li>
<li>Sam is a freelance .NET developer</li>
<li>Sam is based up near Birmingham</li>
<li>Sam wants to do something about helping churches get sermons online</li>
</ul>

<p>That's about it, I look forward to seeing what the problem is, and how he wants it solved.</p>
