<p>This week (I&#39;m writing this on <strong>Sunday</strong>) on my grand adventure of <a href="/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html">&quot;building stuff for people&quot;</a>, I am going to help <a href="http://twitter.com/samuel_d_jack">@samuel_d-jack</a> build a start-up.</p>
<p>Because I&#39;m not yet in the office and don&#39;t know what is expected of me there is little I can say about what I&#39;ll be doing yet, I&#39;ll be writing a blog post each day for publishing in order at some point in the future, so these posts are going to show up out of kilter (I think the final one will be on a Tuesday even though it was penned on a Friday - oh well)</p>
<p>What I do know</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam occasionally works on RavenDB</li>
<li>Sam is a freelance .NET developer</li>
<li>Sam is based up near Birmingham</li>
<li>Sam wants to do something about helping churches get sermons online</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s about it, I look forward to seeing what the problem is, and how he wants it solved.</p>
