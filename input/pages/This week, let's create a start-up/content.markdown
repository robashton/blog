This week (I'm writing this on **Sunday**) on my grand adventure of ["building stuff for people"](/entries/i-am-not-looking-for-a-job.html), I am going to help [@samuel_d-jack](http://twitter.com/samuel_d_jack) build a start-up.

I'm actually writing this on Monday morning so I'm not yet in the office and don't know what is expected of me, I'll be writing a blog post each day for publishing the next day, so my final write-up will appear on Saturday (ooh, a blog post on Saturday, that'll break the mold)

What I do know

- Sam occasionally works on RavenDB
- Sam is a freelance .NET developer
- Sam is based up near Birmingham
- Sam wants to do something about helping churches get sermons online

That's about it, I look forward to seeing what the problem is, and how he wants it solved.
