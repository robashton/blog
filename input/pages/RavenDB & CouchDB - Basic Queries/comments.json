This is why it's great for low-write, high-read scenarios, because reads just look at an already computed index and are incredibly cheap.I wouldn't say it becomes *costly*, because of it being a background task, but sure - the more indexes you add, the more effort the server will have to make to keep them up to date as data is inserted/modified. That's when you look at scaling out by adding more servers and perhaps splitting your data/indexes out over those servers and using sharding strategies or whatever makes sense.\r\n\t\t\t\t"},{"author":{"name":"Simone Chiaretta","avatar":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=444625287c652a4e31f4a271905b713a&size=50&default=identicon"},"date":"(6/2/2010 11:09 AM)","text":"\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIndexes here are not like indexes in relational databases: they looks to me a lot like stored procedures.What happens if I want to do the same query without having the index?
