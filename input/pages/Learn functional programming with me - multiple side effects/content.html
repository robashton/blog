<p>Next up, what I want to do with my Space Invaders game is to have other side effects taking place as a result of shooting enemies.</p>

</ul>

<p>Side effects are an interesting one, we have an activity which is the collision of a bullet with an enemy. There are several side effects as a result of this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Destruction of the enemy</li>
<li>Destruction of the bullet</li>
<li>Increase of the score</li>
<li>Potential restart of the level</li>
<li>Creation of an explosion where the enemy used to be</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, we actually have 3/5 of these already, although they're not being explicitly modelled as side effects of a collision (they're just reading the state to work out whether stuff needs to happen)</p>
