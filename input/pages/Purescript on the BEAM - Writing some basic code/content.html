<p>I&#39;ve got the tools for building Purescript, I&#39;ve got an empty repo - what now then?</p>
<h3 id="writing-some-code">Writing some code</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t want to leap off into writing a fully fledged gen server in Purescript, I&#39;d settle with being able to spawn an Erlang shell and invoking a function I&#39;ve written in - baby steps and all that. </p>
<p>So, creating a file in ps_src called &quot;mycode.purs&quot;, let&#39;s get a hello world sorted and see what we can see.</p>

  pure $ unit</code></pre><p>I guess the first thing we notice here is that we have as many import statements as we do lines of code - this seems to be a thing with languages like this - indeed some of our Elm modules have nearly a whole page of imports at the top of them. Apparently the trick is to get something installed to help you with managing the damned things - I&#39;ve not done that yet, I need to do that - maybe I&#39;ll do that soon - but for now, manually importing stuff as the compiler bitches at me seems to be getting me just as far as I need.</p>
<p>We have a function called &#39;hi&#39; that returns an <em><a href="https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/guides/Eff.md">Effect</a></em> which yields a value of type <em>Unit</em>, bleh - let&#39;s not worry about monads and stuff and just accept that you need to return Effects from functions if you want side effects like printing to screen or writing to a database, or spinning a new process up, that&#39;ll just be a theme from now on. When interacting with native Erlang code this is typically going to be the shape of things, as Erlang is very much not a pure functional environment.</p>
<p>The code is as simple as, &quot;use do notation to perform some side effects, then return &quot;unit&quot; to whatever is going to call our function (either in another do block or so from Erlang itself).</p>
<pre><code>rebar3 <span class="hljs-keyword">compile</span></code></pre><p>A pile of stuff happens, and I end up with some beams in ebin, notably I end up with *&quot;<a href="mailto:myCode@ps.beam">myCode@ps.beam</a>&quot;*  - Purescript modules end up camelCase with a @ps suffix so core Purescript modules don&#39;t clash with the default Erlang modules, this may well change over the coming year but for now that&#39;s now it is.</p>

Hi everybody
unit</code></pre><p>And I get my side effect and my return result from within the Purescript - this isn&#39;t terribly useful if I&#39;m to be calling Purescript code from Erlang code, and given that OTP kinda requires that we have the ability to do that, that&#39;ll be something I need to sort out in the next post.</p>
