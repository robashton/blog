<p>So, this is a niche case that is quite annoying for people writing transformers as part of a map or a map/reduce index - and now we have the ability to specify transformers separately to the index this problem only gets worse.</p>
<p>What is this problem?</p>
<p>Well, if I make a map that does this:</p>
<pre><code>public <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> Ponies : AbstractIndexCreationTask&lt;Pony&gt;
{
   public <span class="hljs-constructor">Ponies()</span> {
     Map =<span class="hljs-function"> <span class="hljs-params">ponies</span> =&gt;</span>
           from pony <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> ponies
           select <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> {
             pony.Name,
             pony.Colour,
             pony.CutieMark
           }

     <span class="hljs-constructor">Store(<span class="hljs-params">pony</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-params">pony</span>.CutieMark, FieldStorage.Yes)</span>;
     <span class="hljs-constructor">Store(<span class="hljs-params">pony</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-params">pony</span>.Name, FieldStorage.Yes)</span>;
     <span class="hljs-constructor">Store(<span class="hljs-params">pony</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-params">pony</span>.Colour, FieldStorage.Yes)</span>;
   }
}</code></pre><p>Available to me <em>without even loading the document</em> after performing a query, is &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Colour&quot;, and &quot;CutieMark&quot;. Obviously we can store other things in there as well, and so some funky things in the map - but this is the essence of this functionality.</p>
<p>The same thing happens by default when you apply a reduce stage to an index, because you lose the original document entirely because of aggregation.</p>
<p>This can be a bit confusing, as sometimes you want the result from that store data, and sometimes you want the data from the document, and this has been an all-or-nothing thing.</p>
<p>Now we can <a href="/entries/result-transformers---not-just-for-querying.html">Use Load&lt;&gt;</a> with a ResultTransformer, this is even more ambiguous.</p>
<p>So, from now on, whenever you access anything in a ResultTransformer, RavenDB will first look in the stored fields for the information, and if not found - will load the document associated with the current result and fetch it from that.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a small change, but one which will remove a lot of the confusion around this feature.</p>
