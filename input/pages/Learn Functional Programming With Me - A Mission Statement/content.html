<p>I was at NDC2012 last week and ended up hanging around the tongue-in-cheek &quot;Hipster stand&quot; along with a fine bunch of people who sat around coding and chatting most of the week on various interesting projects.</p>
<p>One of those fine people was <a href="https://twitter.com/bodiltv">@bodiltv</a> who proclaimed their love for Lisp, Emacs and various other things that I thought (like most people) I&#39;d left behind after university never to touch again.</p>
<p>However, functional programming is something that is seeing somewhat of a re-emergence in the crowds of people who I tend to lump into a bucket of &quot;Smarter than Rob&quot;, and I was looking for an excuse to give it a go - having to build something with somebody sat next to me to show me the ropes was an excellent motivator.</p>
<p>Over the course of a couple of hours on Thursday, <a href="https://twitter.com/bodiltv">@bodiltv</a> and I sat down and wrote a simple little script that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>(<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">ns</span></span> foo.core 
(<span class="hljs-symbol">:use</span> [net.cgrand.enlive-html <span class="hljs-symbol">:as</span> html])  
)

(<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">BASEURL</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&quot;</span>)

(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">fetch-url</span> [url]
  (<span class="hljs-name">html/html-resource</span> (<span class="hljs-name">java.net.URL.</span> url)))

(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">define</span>
  <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Fetches a page from wikipedia and prints the first paragraph&quot;</span>
    [q]
      (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">let</span></span> [url (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">str</span></span> BASEURL q)
           content (<span class="hljs-name">fetch-url</span> url)]
           ((<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">comp</span></span> html/text
                  first
                  html/select) content [<span class="hljs-symbol">:#mw-content-text</span> <span class="hljs-symbol">:p</span>])
      )
)</code></pre><p>We also then looked at futures and how such things like that could help us, and with the knowledge of state being immutable know that we were safe when doing so. I then asked the question that most people ask when encountering this stuff for the (first/second) time, &quot;How on earth do you build something <em>real</em> with this stuff&quot;.</p>
<p>So here goes, a mission statement - <em>I am going to build space invaders on top of HTML5 Canvas with Clojurescript</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, I am breaking out the blog again and relying on YOU, the reader who knows more about these things than I do to guide me on my way as I inevitably make lots of mistakes.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to do this, because on the surface of things it seems so far away from the style of development I am used to, but by learning out in the open I am hoping we&#39;ll accelerate the process of getting to the point where I can be productive in a functional environment.</p>
<p>Next entry: Let&#39;s see what my environment is going to look like, how I am going to interact with the Canvas and structure myself during this experiment.</p>
