<p>Okay, back to more practical things now we've covered how easy <a href="/entries/evented-github-adventure---temporal-averages.html">temporal queries are with the event store</a>.</p>

<p>Ever wondered how happy developers from different languages were? Well, let's find out </p>

<p>First off, I downloaded a list of words for both positive and negative sentiment from the internet, here are the references to the studies done which provided these word lists for use:</p>

<pre><code>   Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. "Mining and Summarizing Customer Reviews."
       Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge
       Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2004), Aug 22-25, 2004, Seattle,
       Washington, USA, 
   Bing Liu, Minqing Hu and Junsheng Cheng. "Opinion Observer: Analyzing
       and Comparing Opinions on the Web." Proceedings of the 14th
       International World Wide Web conference (WWW-2005), May 10-14,
       2005, Chiba, Japan.
</code></pre>

<p>So, how to use this? Well, I just pasted the list of words into a file in vim, and ran a macro over them to convert them into two arrays like so:</p>

<pre><code>var happyWords = [ "yay", "funsome", "winsome" ]
var sadWords = [ "boo", "crap", "lame" ]
</code></pre>

<p>There are actually about 5000 words in total, but essentially what I'm going to do is partition by language and keep a count of </p>

<ul>
<li>How many commits per language I see</li>
<li>How many happy words I see in each commit</li>
<li>How many sad words I see in each commit</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, real sentiment analysis is a little more complicated than simply looking for words, but we'll be happy with this for now, let's have a look at the projection:</p>

<pre><code>function collectHappinessIndexOfCommit(commit, state) {
   var index = 0
   for(var i in happyWords) {
       if(commit.message.indexOf(happyWords[i]) &gt;= 0)
          state.happycount++
   }
   for(var i in sadWords) {
       if(commit.message.indexOf(sadWords[i]) &gt;= 0)
          state.sadcount++
   }
   state.commits++
}

fromStreams(['github-commits'])
  .partitionBy(function(ev) {
    if(ev.body.repo)
      return ev.body.repo.language
  })
  .when({
    "$init": function() {
      return { 
         commits: 0, sadcount: 0, happycount: 0
      }
    },
    "Commit": function(state, ev) {
       collectHappinessIndexOfCommit(ev.body.commit, state)
    },
  })
</code></pre>

<p>I guess I'll say that my "happiness index" can be expressed by </p>

<pre><code>var index = happycount / sadcount
</code></pre>

<p>Or something similar (not the point of this post, if you want to change it then modify the JS on this page..), let's have a look at the chart of happiness over languages</p>

<div id="scaled"></div>

<p>Wow, look at those guys writing Delphi! Presumably they've got the best work/life balance ever known, or they know something the rest of us don't. The folk doing Puppet? I guess when your job is automating the crap that nobody else wants to touch you're going to be pretty miserable most of the time ;-)</p>

<p>Actually, most of the "old school" languages hang around to the right and the "new school" to the left - is this an indication that unhappy people jump ship sooner than others?</p>

<p><em>Note: The differences are actually hilariously small, and although there is a huge amount of data it is likely not statistically that relevant, this is just a bit of fun</em></p>
