<p>As I write my Clojure and the related blog posts, I've been having them reviewed by <a href="http://twitter/bodil">@bodil</a> who is a proper functional programming neckbeard emacs type.</p>

<p>Her most recent piece of feedback was</p>

<p><blockquote>
    What strikes me about your code right now is that it's not very composable
  </blockquote></p>

<p>Well I have to admit I had no idea what she meant by this, although it was in reference to a problem I was highlighting myself of <em>I'm passing too much data around</em></p>

<p>It turns out that this is pretty much what the FP guys mean when they say that code isn't composable.</p>

<p>Obeerne of the beautiful things about the way languages like Clojure make you build up code, is that the functions you write are supposed to be re-usable across very basic and well-known data structures.</p>

<h3>Composability and Types</h3>

<p><a href="http://clojure.org/sequences">Sequences</a> are probably the best structures to be operating on top of, maybe with some primitives as directives of how to operate on them. </p>

<p>User defined structures such as a "vector" probably come in next and then my big chunk of state as a hash... well that's the worst - especially if I'm passing it around as one big thing all the time.</p>

<p>With that in mind, suddenly we have a use for defined data structures like records (something I have been putting off for a while), and perhaps I can begin to solve my awkward relationship with that big ball of state. Something I have been muttering about for the past few blog entries.</p>

<p>So, I've read the <a href="http://clojure.org/datatypes">page on types</a> in Clojure and from what I understand it seems that deftype is for structures with no behaviour, and defrecord is for more OOP scenarios but there is also <a href="http://clojure.org/protocols">defprotocol</a> which is somehow related to both and will probably help me with my current data-ball-of-mud problem.</p>

<p>To further confound me, the docs have snippets like this in them</p>

<p><blockquote>
  Protocols are fully reified
  </blockquote></p>

<p>I'll need a dictionary and a copy of SICP to understand this and my brain is melting a bit so I go to find wine. Nice cool wine on a terrace overlooking St Pauls Cathedral and try to make sense of these docs a bit more.</p>

<h3>Composability and Space Invaders</h3>

<p>Starting at the other end of the problem - away from wordy confusion, it's very easy to see that there are some basic data types in my Space Invaders game and I have some basic operations over the top of them.</p>

<p>First up, I'm passing 'rects' all over the place, and a rect is defined as </p>

<pre><code>x : LHS of the rect
y : TOP of the rect
w : Width of the rect
h : Height of the rect
</code></pre>

<p>That's the state, and there are some basic operations over the top of this - some which involve mutation and some which do not</p>

<ul>
<li>Draw it (no mutation of internal state) </li>
<li>bottom of the rect (no mutation)</li>
<li>RHS of the rect (no mutation)</li>
<li>move left/right/up/down (mutation - perhaps just 'move')</li>
</ul>

<p>From what I understand of the docs, I could probably get a lot done by defining a rect as a record, and exposing these as methods on that record, this might make some of the code easier to follow.</p>

<p>I could also use a protocol to describe two things as being 'collideable' (a suggestion from my tutor), which is the Clojure equivalent to an interface if I understand correctly.</p>

<h3>No code here</h3>

<p>I'll leave the implementation of this to the next post, as this is quite a lot of data to digest and I highly recommend reading the above docs if you're following along with my learning.</p>
