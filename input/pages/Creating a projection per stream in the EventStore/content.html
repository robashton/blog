<p><a href="/entries/re-partitioning-streams-in-the-event-store-for-better-projections.html">Now I have a stream per pony</a>, I want to create a projection per pony, but how do we do this?</p>

<p>Well, so far we've seen these two methods to get the events for our projection</p>

<ul>
<li>fromAny: Give us the events from all the streams</li>
<li>fromStream: Give us the event from a specific stream</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, now is the time to introduct another method we have at our disposal</p>

<ul>
<li>fromCategory: Run this for each "category"</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, what on earth IS a category? Turns out that the EventStore is quite clever and one of the default projections is hard at work looking at streams and categorising them.</p>

<p>I called my streams pony-PONYNAME for good reason, because this default projection will have gone "Hey, there is a dash in that stream, I'm going to create a category called pony, and each entry in that category is going to be a PONYNAME"</p>

<p>That leaves us with</p>

<pre><code>fromCategory('pony')
  .foreachStream()
  .when({
    "$init": function(state, ev) {
      return { count: 0 }
    },
    "PonyJumped": function(state, ev) {
      state.count++
    }
  })
</code></pre>

<p>For each stream in the category "pony", please run this projection code!</p>

<p><strong>Reading back the state</strong></p>

<p>We can now look at the state per pony by visiting the /state and passing in the partition we care about in the query string</p>

<p><em>/projection/jumpingponies2/state?partition=rainbowdash</em></p>

<pre><code>{
  count: 2000
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>/projection/jumpingponies2/state?partition=pinkiepie</em></p>

<pre><code>{
  count: 300
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>/projection/jumpingponies2/state?partition=derpy</em></p>

<pre><code>{
  count: 10
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>

<p>It's at this point, people usually ask "How about giving me a list of ponies so I can look up the state for each of them", this is <em>not</em> what you use the EventStore for. </p>

<p>The list of ponies is something that should exist in your domain and be stored in a database (whether this be a document or relational database), and then used to look up values in the event store.</p>

<p>This could either be a fixed list in one of those stores, or you could run through the streams in the EventStore and build up that list as a read model in that external store. <em>This is the only time I'm going to mention this in this series :)</em></p>
