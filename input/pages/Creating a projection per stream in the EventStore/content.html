<p><a href="/entries/re-partitioning-streams-in-the-event-store-for-better-projections.html">Now I have a stream per pony</a>, I want to create a projection per pony, but how do we do this?</p>
<p>Well, so far we&#39;ve seen these two methods to get the events for our projection</p>
<ul>
<li>fromAny: Give us the events from all the streams</li>
<li>fromStream: Give us the event from a specific stream</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, now is the time to introduct another method we have at our disposal</p>
<ul>
<li>fromCategory: Run this for each &quot;category&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, what on earth IS a category? Turns out that the EventStore is quite clever and one of the default projections is hard at work looking at streams and categorising them.</p>
<p>I called my streams pony-PONYNAME for good reason, because this default projection will have gone &quot;Hey, there is a dash in that stream, I&#39;m going to create a category called pony, and each entry in that category is going to be a PONYNAME&quot;</p>
<p>That leaves us with</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span>Category(&#x27;pony&#x27;)
  .foreachStream()
  .when({
    <span class="hljs-string">&quot;$init&quot;</span>: function(<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>, ev) {
      return { count: <span class="hljs-number">0</span> }
    },
    <span class="hljs-string">&quot;PonyJumped&quot;</span>: function(<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>, ev) {
      <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>.count++
    }
  })</code></pre><p>For each stream in the category &quot;pony&quot;, please run this projection code!</p>
<p><strong>Reading back the state</strong></p>
<p>We can now look at the state per pony by visiting the /state and passing in the partition we care about in the query string</p>
<p><em>/projection/jumpingponies2/state?partition=rainbowdash</em></p>
<pre><code>{
  <span class="hljs-attr">count:</span> <span class="hljs-number">2000</span>
}</code></pre><p><em>/projection/jumpingponies2/state?partition=pinkiepie</em></p>
<pre><code>{
  <span class="hljs-built_in">count</span>: <span class="hljs-number">300</span>
}</code></pre><p><em>/projection/jumpingponies2/state?partition=derpy</em></p>
<pre><code>{
  <span class="hljs-built_in">count</span>: <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
}</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s at this point, people usually ask &quot;How about giving me a list of ponies so I can look up the state for each of them&quot;, this is <em>not</em> what you use the EventStore for. </p>
<p>The list of ponies is something that should exist in your domain and be stored in a database (whether this be a document or relational database), and then used to look up values in the event store.</p>
<p>This could either be a fixed list in one of those stores, or you could run through the streams in the EventStore and build up that list as a read model in that external store. <em>This is the only time I&#39;m going to mention this in this series :)</em></p>
