
		<p>I've been contacted quite a bit this past month with requests for workshops and short term consultancy on RavenDB - I'm thrilled to bits that the database seems to be taking off in this way and I'm all about helping this happen.</p>

<p>The short answer is yes, I am happy to come and do private workshops tailored around your company's needs with RavenDB, I am also happy to offer remote or on-site consultancy where appropriate/desired.</p>

<p>If you've too been wondering about this but not known where to look, just e-mail me at <a href="mailto:robashton@codeofrob.com">robashton@codeofrob.com</a>, I don't bite.</p>

<p>That's about it really, I'll use this space to say that I'm now nearly settled in Belgium on a long term project for a client and I'm ready to commence blogging again, I've a few things I want to cover with RavenDB in particular but I'll most likely be doing that over at <a href="http://codebetter.com">codebetter.com</a></p>
