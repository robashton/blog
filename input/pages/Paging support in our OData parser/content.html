<p>Which is nice. Now I want to add paging support in the form of </p>

<p>$top and $skip, while I'm at it I may as well add support for $inlinecount because it's pretty much the same thing.</p>

<p>This should be fairly easy, this is what I want to support:</p>

<pre><code>/some/path?$top=5&amp;limit=skip=100
/some/path?$inlinecount=allpages
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Top and Skip</strong></p>

<p>These are quite simple, just text and a number, let's write a couple of tests</p>

<pre><code>test("/some/resource?$top=5&amp;$skip=100", "OData", function(result) {
  it("top should be specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.options.$top, 5)
  })
  it("skip should be specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.options.$skip, 100)
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>I just need to add these to the list of recognised query options</p>

<pre><code>QueryOption = 
    SortOption
  | TopOption
  | SkipOption
  | OperationParam
,
</code></pre>

<p>This is where the elegance of OMeta makes me really happy, being able to easily say what the options for something are in this way is really pretty.</p>

<p>So, TopOption</p>

<pre><code>TopOption = 
  seq("$top=") Number:value -&gt; { name: "$top", value: value }
,
</code></pre>

<p>and SkipOption</p>

<pre><code>SkipOption = 
  seq("$skip=") Number:value -&gt; { name: "$skip", value: value }
,
</code></pre>

<p>Can't say fairer than that!</p>

<p><strong>inlinecount</strong></p>

<p>This one is a bit more interesting, the only valid options are <em>none</em> and <em>allpages</em>, and we're supposed to return a 404 if we don't match. We're not currently doing anything with HTTP in this parser so what I'll actually do is accept "any text" and leave it up to the consumer to do this job for us. (Rather than throw a generic <em>I can't parse this</em> exception)</p>

<pre><code>test("/some/resource?$inlinecount=allpages", "OData", function(result) {
  it("inline should be specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.options.$inlinecount, "allpages")
  })
})

test("/some/resource?$inlinecount=none", "OData", function(result) {
  it("inline should be specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.options.$inlinecount, "none")
  })
})

test("/some/resource?$inlinecount=flibble", "OData", function(result) {
  it("inline should be specified", function() {
     assert.equal(result.options.$inlinecount, "")
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>I want explicit handling for this because it'll help with the highlighting efforts in the editor that  this will be used in.</p>

<p>We can add it like so</p>

<pre><code>QueryOption = 
    SortOption
  | TopOption
  | SkipOption
  | InlineCountOption
  | OperationParam
,
</code></pre>

<p>And handle our explcit decisions like so</p>

<pre><code>InlineCountOption =
  seq("$inlinecount=") 
  (
    seq("allpages") -&gt; "allpages"
  | seq("none") -&gt; "none"
  | Text -&gt; ""
  ):value -&gt; { name: "$inlinecount", value: value }
,
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Et voila</strong></p>

<p>So that's paging done and dusted, incredibly simple when you know how. Next up we'll explore the murky world of OData filtering.</p>
