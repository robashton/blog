<p><a href="http://github.com/robashton/vir">Vir</a> is a bunching together of various scripts we had lying around our projects written in a combination of Bash and Erlang to manage the execution/release/etc process for our applications. It does what we need to do and stops about there - I suspect the best way of using Vir is to either use it as it is or fork it for your own organisation rather than trying to make it help everybody.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get started with vir is to clone it to ~/.vir and add this folder to the path, but it&#39;ll work if you just add it to a GH repo and run it locally to so... whatever - do what you want it&#39;s just a bash script.</p>
<p>Anyway, running vir should give us a list of possible commands, for now we&#39;ll just create an empty web application in a folder, so do something like the below..</p>
<pre><code>mkdir awesomeapp
cd awesomeapp
git init
vir init -t web awesome
git commit <span class="keyword">...</span>
</code></pre><p>This creates an application called &quot;<em>awesome</em>&quot; (and builds it) based off the <em>web</em> and gives us a folder structure that looks similar to below:</p>
<p>As mentioned in a previous blog entry, this is at immediate glance a lot to digest, but we can go through it a little at a time and see just what has been created for us.</p>
<p><strong>Config</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="title">apps</span>/awesome/release-files/sys.config
<span class="title">apps</span>/awesome/src/awesome_config.erl
</code></pre><p>sys.config is a standalone file containing various key-value pairs of config and awesome_config is a wrapper that provides an API to read that file. Not much to see here.</p>
<p><strong>Application startup</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="title">apps</span>/awesome/src/awesome_app.erl
<span class="title">apps</span>/awesome/src/awesome_sup.erl
</code></pre><p>An application requires something that implements the OTP Behaviour &quot;Application&quot; (<em>awesome_app.erl</em>), and if I want child processes within the structure I&#39;ll need a supervisor to manager them, that&#39;s (<em>awesome_sup.erl</em>).</p>
<p><strong>A web application</strong></p>
<pre><code>apps/awesome/src/<span class="filename">awesome_cowboy.erl
</code></pre><p>This is just a OTP genserver that uses Cowboy (one of our dependencies) to create a simple http listener.</p>
<p><strong>Release artifacts</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="title">deployment</span>/build_no
<span class="title">deployment</span>/major_ver
<span class="title">deployment</span>/minor_ver
</code></pre><p>This is a cheap way of bumping version for the application during a release cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Dependencies</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="title">deps</span>/cowboy/
<span class="title">deps</span>/cowlib/
<span class="title">deps</span>/edown/
<span class="title">deps</span>/gen_leader/
<span class="title">deps</span>/goldrush/
<span class="title">deps</span>/gproc/
<span class="title">deps</span>/jsx/
<span class="title">deps</span>/lager/
<span class="title">deps</span>/ranch/
</code></pre><p>Lots of folders containing lots more of the above. They were cloned and brought in because the Makefile contains a list of dependencies.</p>
<p>In reality we&#39;re only explicitly bringing in <em>cowboy</em>, <em>gproc</em>, <em>jsx</em> and <em>lager</em> and the others are further dependencies of these. Because Erlang operates in a single global namespace you can&#39;t do explicit imports ala NodeJS and have multiple versions of things in the application.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter too much anyway because dependency applications often spin up a fleet of processes on start-up rather than simply operating as library code, so you wouldn&#39;t want more than one version of an application running within a project.</p>
<p><strong>Various Manifests</strong></p>
<pre><code>apps/awesome/relx<span class="variable">.config</span>
apps/awesome/src/awesome<span class="variable">.app</span><span class="variable">.src</span>
</code></pre><p><em>relx.config</em> is a manifest specifying how to do a release with all the appropriate files, and <em>awesome.app.src</em> tells the boot system what state our application needs to be in before it can be started.</p>
<p><strong>A Makefile</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="attribute">Makefile
</code></pre><p>Yup, we use make.</p>
<h1 id="using-it">Using it</h1>
<p>So how do we use this? Well the bash script we just ran probably did all this already but loosely our general dev cycle will be</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">make</span> -j apps         <span class="comment">#  "make in parallel, the apps only, ignore the deps"</span>
vir run awesome      <span class="comment">#  "vir, run the app please"</span>
</code></pre><p>If we add new dependencies, then we&#39;ll need to run the following command after a build before running</p>
<pre><code>vir boot             # <span class="keyword">Generate</span> bootscripts <span class="keyword">for</span> each application based <span class="keyword">on</span> the manifests
</code></pre><p>So what do we have when it starts up? Well, let&#39;s look at the logs first</p>

Eshell V6<span class="number">.1</span>  (abort <span class="keyword">with</span> ^G)
</code></pre><p>Neato, we see all the applications specified in <em>awesome.app.src</em> started up. (Mode dev isn&#39;t found because we haven&#39;t got one and that&#39;s the default mode)</p>
<p>This is awesome.app.src for reference.</p>
<pre><code><span class="cell">{application, awesome,
 [

  <span class="cell">{vsn, "<span class="number">1.0</span><span class="number">.0</span>"}</span>,

   ]}</span>,
  <span class="cell">{mod, { awesome_app, []}</span>},
  <span class="cell">{env, []}</span>
  ]}.
</code></pre><p>See what I mean about dependencies not simply being a pile of code, that list of folders we have in deps contain actual applications that are started up before awesome_app itself.</p>
<p>Is it working?</p>
<pre><code>curl http://localhost:3000/index.html
<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">html</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">head</span>&gt;</span>

  <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">body</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">html</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>Yup.</p>
<h1 id="next-up">Next up</h1>
<p>I&#39;ll look at our Makefile and how we handle dependencies, and explain a bit more our decisions around that.</p>
