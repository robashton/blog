<p><a href="http://github.com/robashton/vir">Vir</a> is a bunching together of various scripts we had lying around our projects written in a combination of Bash and Erlang to manage the execution/release/etc process for our applications. It does what we need to do and stops about there - I suspect the best way of using Vir is to either use it as it is or fork it for your own organisation rather than trying to make it help everybody.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get started with vir is to clone it to ~/.vir and add this folder to the path, but it&#39;ll work if you just add it to a GH repo and run it locally to so... whatever - do what you want it&#39;s just a bash script.</p>
<p>Anyway, running vir should give us a list of possible commands, for now we&#39;ll just create an empty web application in a folder, so do something like the below..</p>
<pre><code>mkdir awesomeapp
cd awesomeapp
git init
vir init -t web awesome
git commit <span class="keyword">...</span>
</code></pre><p>This creates an application (and builds it) based off the web template called &#39;awesome&#39; and gives us a folder structure that looks similar to below:</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, this is at immediate glance a lot to digest, but we can go through it a little at a time and see just what has been created for us.</p>
<p><strong>Config</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="title">apps</span>/awesome/release-files/sys.config
<span class="title">apps</span>/awesome/src/awesome_config.erl
</code></pre><p><strong>Application startup</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="title">apps</span>/awesome/src/awesome_app.erl
<span class="title">apps</span>/awesome/src/awesome_sup.erl
</code></pre><p><strong>A web application</strong></p>
<pre><code>apps/awesome/src/<span class="filename">awesome_cowboy.erl
</code></pre><p><strong>Release artifacts</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="title">apps</span>/awesome/relx.config
<span class="title">deployment</span>/build_no
<span class="title">deployment</span>/major_ver
<span class="title">deployment</span>/minor_ver
</code></pre><p><strong>Dependencies</strong></p>
<p>  deps/cowboy/
  deps/cowlib/
  deps/edown/
  deps/gen_leader/
  deps/goldrush/
  deps/gproc/
  deps/jsx/
  deps/lager/
  deps/ranch/</p>
<p>In reality we&#39;re only explicitly bringing in <em>cowboy</em>, <em>gproc</em>, <em>jsx</em> and <em>lager</em> and the others are further dependencies of these. Because Erlang operates in a single global namespace you can&#39;t do explicit imports ala NodeJS and have multiple versions of things in the application. Because dependency applications often spin up a fleet of processes on start-up this would cause huge issues anyway because it&#39;s not Just Code you&#39;re bringing in.</p>
<p><strong>A Makefile</strong></p>
<h1 id="using-it">Using it</h1>
<p>So how do we use this? Well the bash script we just ran probably did all this already but loosely our general dev cycle will be</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">make</span> -j apps         <span class="comment">#  "make in parallel, the apps only, ignore the deps"</span>
vir run awesome      <span class="comment">#  "vir, run the app please"</span>
</code></pre><p>If we add new dependencies, then we&#39;ll need to run the following command after a build before running</p>
<pre><code>vir boot             # <span class="keyword">Generate</span> bootscripts <span class="keyword">for</span> each application based <span class="keyword">on</span> the manifests
</code></pre><p>So what do we have when it starts up? Well, let&#39;s look at the logs first</p>

</code></pre><p>Neato, we see all the applications specified in <em>app.src</em> started up. (Mode dev isn&#39;t found because we haven&#39;t got one and that&#39;s the default mode)</p>
<p>Is it working?</p>

</code></pre><p>Yup.</p>
<h1 id="next-up">Next up</h1>
<p>I&#39;ll look at our Makefile and how we handle dependencies, and explain a bit more our decisions around that.</p>
