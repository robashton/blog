I've been told I need to tell people when I'm doing talks, so consider this my attempt at making this so.

I'll be talking at [Devsum 2013](http://devsum.se/) on the 29th/30th of May on the [pragmatic outside-in testing of ASP.NET MVC applications](http://devsum.se/talare/rob-ashton/)

I went to Devsum last year and had a lot of fun, last year the venue was just down the road from an Irish Pub and that pretty much put the icing on the cake. Let me know if you're going to be there and we can organise a guinness driven get-together.
