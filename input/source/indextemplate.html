          <p>I'm Rob Ashton, a freelance software developer from Britain but currently operating in Belgium.</p>
          <p>I like delivering, and I like helping teams deliver - I am often found leading technical teams on technical products, and spend a lot of my time mentoring and coaching teams to deliver more effective code.</p>
          <p>I believe that the best code is code that can be maintained by others, I don't believe in black boxes, I don't believe in magic tricks and I think that the most direct route to a solution is often the best one.</p>
          <p>I have contributed code to a number of OSS projects, most notably RavenDB but these days I focus my efforts on games development in Javascript - because it's fun. I like having fun.</p>
          <p>I also believe that things change, my opinions in chronological order across the blog entries of this site are proof of that</p>
