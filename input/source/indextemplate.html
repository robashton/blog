        <div class="blurb">
          <p>I'm Rob Ashton, a freelance software developer from Britain but currently operating in Belgium.</p>
          <p>I like delivering, and I like helping teams deliver - I am often found leading technical teams on technical products, and spend a lot of my time mentoring and coaching teams to deliver more effective code.</p>
          <p>I believe that the best code is code that can be maintained by others, I don't believe in black boxes, I don't believe in magic tricks and I think that the most direct route to a solution is often the best one.</p>
          <p>I have contributed code to a number of OSS projects, most notably RavenDB but these days I focus my efforts on games development in Javascript - because it's fun. I like having fun.</p>
          <p>I also believe that things change, my opinions in chronological order across the blog entries of this site are proof of that</p>

        <h3>Things I've worked on</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Hoverbattles</h4>
          <img src="http://codeofrob.com/img/hoverbattles.png" />
          <a href="http://github.com/robashton/hoverbattles">http://github.com/robashton/hoverbattles</a>
          <p>Hoverbattles was an experiment in writing a full-stack multi-player JavaScript game using WebGL and websockets, the code isn't pretty but it taught me a lot!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Zombify</h4>
          <img src="http://codeofrob.com/img/zombie.png" />
          <a href="http://github.com/robashton/zombify">http://github.com/robashton/zombify</a>
          <p>Zombify is an attempt to make it easy to write end-to-end tests for ASP.NET MVC projects in JavaScript that run quickly, it works.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>RavenDB</h4>
          <img src="http://codeofrob.com/img/ravendb.png" />
          <a href="http://github.com/ravendb/ravendb">http://github.com/ravendb/ravendb</a>
          <p>This document database isn't mine, but I contributed some important features to it back in the beginning :-)</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Swallow</h4>
          <img src="http://codeofrob.com/img/swallow.png" />

          <p>Asset packing for web-based games - I use this if I'm not using an engine and want to download all the things at once!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Molyhole</h4>
          <img src="http://codeofrob.com/img/molyhole.png" />
          <a href="http://github.com/robashton/molyhole">http://github.com/robashton/molyhole</a>
          <p>A 48 hour creation for "molyjam", a rather unique game jam indeed</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Plane Thinking</h4>
          <img src="http://codeofrob.com/img/planethinking.png" />
          <a href="http://github.com/robashton/plane-thinking">http://github.com/robashton/plane-thinking</a>
          <p>a 48 hour creation as a warm-up for Ludum Dare 22, it's an awful game but it works</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>LD22 -  You don't have to be alone</h4>
          <img src="http://codeofrob.com/img/ld22.png" />
          <a href="http://github.com/robashton/ld48-22">http://github.com/robashton/ld48-22</a>
          <p>My first Ludum Dare Game jam entry, a 48 hour creation which crashes in most browsers after 5 minutes. Oops!</p>
          <p>A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp_nxjhx6yY">>time-lapse</a> is available, as is the <a href="http://ld22-ashton.heroku.com/">game itself</a></p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>LD23 -  Tiny earth protector</h4>

          <a href="http://github.com/robashton/ld4823tw">http://github.com/robashton/ld4823tw</a>
          <p>MY second Ludum Dare Game jam entry, a 48 hour creation that works well - but the game play is a bit slow until later levels. Lesson learned!</p>
          <p><a href="http://tinyprotector.herokuapp.com/">The game itself</a> is available</p>
        </div>

          <h4>A relaxed attitude towards the pragmatic delivery of "okay" software</h4>
          <img src="http://codeofrob.com/img/hoverbattles.png" />
          <a href="http://codeofrob.com/entries/a-relaxed-attitude-towards-the-pragmatic-delivery-of-okay-software.html">"/a-relaxed-attitude-towards-the-pragmatic-delivery-of-okay-software.html</a>
          <p>A mid project retrospective of Hoverbattles, describing my approach to building software at the time, I still mostly agree with it</p>
        </div>

          <h4>CQRS is too complicated</h4>
          <img src="http://codeofrob.com/img/CQRS.png" />
          <a href="http://codeofrob.com/entries/cqrs-is-too-complicated.html">"/cqrs-is-too-complicated.html</a>
          <p>Okay, it's link-bait - I actually write about the different types of CQRS, and how it evolves to manage different kinds of complexity</p>
